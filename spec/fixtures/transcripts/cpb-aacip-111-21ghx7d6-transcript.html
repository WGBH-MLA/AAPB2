Even among ourselves some of us see ourrole as strictly educational. Others want to provide onlylocal community services. Some emphasize services for theunrepresented and the under-represented and accordingly want to use publicbroadcasting as a tool for social dialogue. Others dream ofbringing the finest in the arts drama music and civilization itselfto as many Americans as possible. Some want publicbroadcasting to be the vehicle through which unconventional ideas and issues can bevoiced and debated. And of course everyone in thisroom understands that public broadcasting is and must continue tobe. All of this.</div>

That's what we provide and that's what we do.It's equally important in my view that we not forget who we are.

It can't always hit that mark it shouldn't be expectedto. But we who know it and who support it cannever lose sight of that goal. Howthen in these economically troubled times do we sustain theseimportant activities. There are essentially two sources of incomefor Public Broadcasting in this nation.The first which provides about three quarters of all funding isthe community of television and radio licensees. People like youwho make it work within regulatory limits</div>
</div>
<div class="transcript-row">

The licensees engage in auctionsbenefits and a host of other enterprising activities to sustain theirservices. Without you and without others like youacross this nation we would literally be without a noncommercialbroadcasting service in this country. The other sources ofincome or the other source of income pardon me is theCorporation for Public Broadcasting whose duty as an independent entityis to nurture guide and invigorated Public Broadcasting.The federal commitment CPB receives and invests in public broadcasting hasenabled our services to move from adequacy with which we must never becontent to a general level of excellence to which we must alwaysaspire. Accordingly the federal commitment in my view</div>

We are theonly industrialized nation on the face of this globewhich supports most of its efforts in noncommercial publicbroadcasting through local activity. All the othernations who are our allies support similar activitiesentirely through their national governments.We do not and in my view we should never.Our accomplishments as you know are about to be sorely tested.Federal support is falling off our long range goalmust be to strengthen that federal foundation and thereby strengthenour stations and our national operating institutions.

Thisyear the one hundred seventy two million dollar federal appropriation the largest in our historyis a benchmark in the history of public broadcasting. The nearlydevastating irony is that were we more stable thisbenchmark could serve as a point of fulfillment in terms of the services weare now able to provide. And as a signal to the public of what is still to comeinstead. And unfortunately itis a benchmark which must serve as a resource to be used to get through these nextyears. For 1983 PBSappropriation drops to one hundred thirty seven million dollars for1984 85 and 86. The congressionalauthorization level is one hundred thirty million dollars.

We have thecooperation will have enormous difficulty at that level in meeting costsassociated with critical system support activities. Evenat that level the maximum we can hope to achieve CPB is directsupport to our stations will slip to one acceptably low levels and acommitment to high quality national programming will fall alarmingly belowamounts needed to maintain and sustain those efforts.The American people have invested many many millions of dollars in publicbroadcasting to much I believe for them to see the dividends from thatinvestment dwindle and perhaps vanish. We must assure allAmericans that there is was and continues to be one of the wisestand most thoughtful investments they have ever made. We have already</div>

Work together with theCongress provide information to those who still need to be convincedand inform everyone in Public Broadcasting's growing and vast familyof what is needed and why it is needed. And mostimportant you must intensify your efforts hereat the community level as a first step in thisprocess. We have established a new long range financing taskforce at thecorporation with representatives from the public broadcasting community and thepublic like its highly successful counterparts several years ago.This task force will conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of financingalternatives and funding sources for Public Broadcasting. Our earlyyear long range financing taskforce provided public broadcasting and the Congress</div>

Both very important ingredients in what must be aconstant effort to insulate our enterprise from the federal government itself.This new task force represents an equally important undertakingwithin the next eight months a congressionally created temporarycommission on alternative financing for public broadcasting must present to the Congressa plan for the financing of this institution. Frankly I am heartenedby the very idea that the Congress for the first time wants to help usresolve our financial problems. If we too care we will beabsolutely certain that a plan which puts in place a long range policyfor the continuation of public broadcasting and a revenue base to support itis properly delivered by the temporary commission in mid1982.

It ispart of our pact with the American people. However the hard factremains that for the next few years this source of support will be lessthan it should being. Accordingly we must begin toprovide ways to seek alternative forms of financing.We have to look for other avenues to secure our income.And we must begin as we have begun across thecountry as part of its work the congressionally createdtemporary commission is examining an 18 month long experiment withcluster advertising for broadcast use on our air on our television</div>

The public broadcastingcommunity is a good faith participant in this advertising demonstration project.And of course we'll support the efforts of the temporary commission.I believe that the results of these investigations will prove invaluable to usto the Congress and to all the people of this landon air advertising however again inmy view is not the answer for Public Broadcasting. Not nowand probably not in the future. We have a unique service tooffer to the American public a service which more and more people each yearrecognize and support and public broadcasting from its very firstdays developed and grew as a commercial free undertaking.The limited advertising experiment authorized by the Congressshould be thoroughly explored because our needs are great</div>

This experiment should notdivert or delay us nor should it tire us from the actions wemust take to be certain that this institution survives andprospers.We must never forget what public broadcasting is and why our fellowcitizens permitted us to bring it into existence 30 years ago.Let's assume that we are very successful with all of these efforts to learnand to establish openings to the commercial marketplace. Let'sassume for a moment that we accomplish these ventures without damage to our public and ourindependent status without damage to our more traditional sources ofsupport. The net proceeds as far as we can tellwould very likely not add up to 10 percent of our currentsystem operating budgets across the nation and they would probably noteven equal 30 percent of the greatly reduced federal commitment.</div>

Not unless the millions who watch and listen. Want acompletely different institution.Many people believe in us and they give ustheir support. Many more are willing to help us and we youfor our part must work for stronger understanding greater appreciationand increased support from all Americans. All the possibleresources and energies of the corporation over the next 12 months will be bent tothat end. Without the people we are nothing.

With such a unity in place Public Broadcastingcan have an enduring congressional commitment a stable nationalpolicy which will enable continuing progress asyou know both television and radio have increased listener and viewer support by significantnumbers over the past 10 years. But we must have an evengreater groundswell of support. The people here in Little Rock in Denverin St. Louis and in New York the people in communities across the countrywho want the kind of system which delivers the kind of service they wantmust join with us to get the kind of congressional commitment we simplymust have.

And this period of austerity anduncertainty there can be no place for equivocation or for dissembling.We must build an institution on trust on understanding and oncommitment. There is no longer in my view a choiceI should like to suggest three paths.The first is to strengthen the support of the American people. We must involve peoplemore people in the listening and viewing public. The public who supportsus with voluntary dollars through their states through their communitiesthrough wanting our membership drives that public must grow by at least one millionpeople for television and 200000 people for radio. And thosepeople must be in place by January 1984. Wemust persuade our nation that we are genuinely the people's business.Second we simply must have a longer range commitment from the United States</div>

No longer can this institution have theneed for public broadcasting questioned every two to four years. Themandate should be constant and enduring pact with our fellowcitizens. Third we must probe because wehave obligations and responsibilities and put in place certain openings to thecommercial marketplace. But we must be careful not to endanger thenoncommercial base of what we are and what we do.So we seek one in a quarter million new voluntary subscribersto public television and radio.
