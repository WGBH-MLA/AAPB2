    <div id="para2" class="para" data-timecodebegin="00:00:58.270" data-timecodeend="00:03:43.250">Good afternoon distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen welcome to the dedication of our expanded facilities for Educational Television here in Conway Arkansas. As chairman of the commission I'm pleased to welcome you on behalf of all of the commission. And I'm also pleased to tell you of action taken by the Commission this morning in its meeting at which time a resolution was adopted by the commission naming our expanded facility the arly Reeves Center for Educational telecommunications. This recognizes the predominant influence and leadership that Lee Reeves has had as director of the work of this commission since its inception. And while these 15 years represent we hope only a mild post in the continued growth and progress of educational television in this state. It gave us the opportunity to recognize the significant contributions which this man has made with the cooperation of the other agencies of the state government and with the cooperation of thousands of citizens of the state who have contributed their time and effort in the support of this particular activity. It is appropriate that on this occasion of this dedication we have with us a spokesman for public broadcasting of national stature and I am particularly pleased to note one who has experience in public broadcasting. Our speaker today is Mr. Edward J Feister who has recently been elected president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Prior to going to Washington this fall to assume that position must Feister served as the director of the educational facilities in the educational television facilities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He brings to his position of responsibility with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. A broad career of activities as a journalist as an educator are as one familiar with the work of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And as a practicing broadcaster in the educational television field I'm pleased to welcome him to Arkansas and to introduce him to you for the dedicatory address. Mr. Feist.

There are a couple of people in the audience who know very well and understand how ready I am at almost any time to discuss educational public broadcasting in this country. However today is a most significant honor and I'm doubly pleased to be able to participate because of the extraordinary man we are thanking. Special for more reasons than we have time to recycle this afternoon. He is committed and tireless. He is a man of vision. He is a man who understands only too well that in this democracy vision can be and is accomplished only one and if someone rolls up his sleeves and goes to work. Lee on behalf of all of your colleagues across the United States I want to thank you for being one of us for giving us the gift of your talents so unselfishly just as you have given those talents to this state and to its people. What educational television is here and often saw is due in great part to what many who are here in the studio may not realize is that what educational and public television is today across the south and indeed across the nation is also due in great part to you. So we do want to thank you. There's a second point I should like to make about Lee. I would like just to point up what I think is his extraordinary courage. Imagine the courage of a man from the state whose name is Lee Reeves who permits one of his two children to emigrate to Texas and is able to stay here and continue his own life.

Even among ourselves some of us see our role as strictly educational. Others want to provide only local community services. Some emphasize services for the unrepresented and the under-represented and accordingly want to use public broadcasting as a tool for social dialogue. Others dream of bringing the finest in the arts drama music and civilization itself to as many Americans as possible. Some want public broadcasting to be the vehicle through which unconventional ideas and issues can be voiced and debated. And of course everyone in this room understands that public broadcasting is and must continue to be. All of this.

Public broadcasting in this society must survive to continue to provide the opportunity for its listeners and in radio and radio and its viewers in television to see America in all of its diversity and complexity to reveal to explain to explore to chide and to goad our fellow Americans when necessary. Public broadcasting is that institution which must remind us of our past illuminates our present and yes even occasionally help us to chart a better future. Public broadcasting must serve as a mirror for all Americans as well as other societies and cultures. We must provide the means of expression for creative and talented people as we do today including those whose abilities and gifts might otherwise never be known. The dream and the challenge to inform inspire and educate. This vision of public broadcasting in the United States from its first has never changed. That's what we provide and that's what we do. It's equally important in my view that we not forget who we are. We are educational and public.

    <div id="para10" class="para" data-timecodebegin="00:09:06.960" data-timecodeend="00:12:19.759">Indeed that marketplace is extraordinarily important to what we are. It is to insist that public broadcasting as initiated and as developed is not of that marketplace a commentary made at the time of the first Carnegie report on public television. More than 15 years ago is more eloquent than I can be and it bears repetition and repetition and repetition. Non-commercial television should address itself to the ideal of excellence not the idea of acceptability which is what keeps commercial television from climbing the staircase. Non-commercial television should be the visual counterpart of the literary essay should arouse our dreams satisfy our hunger for beauty take us on journeys and enable us to participate in events present great drama in music explore the sea in the sky in the woods in the hills. It should be our hour to talk with our Minsky's and our Camelot. It should restate and clarify our social dilemma and our political pickle. Once in a while it does that and once in a while you get a quick glimpse of its potential. Remember my friends. That is what we really are. We are noncommercial educational occasionally visionary. Our purpose is to serve in ways which must be always different. There is a difference between commercial broadcasting and public broadcasting. Turn on your set. You'll see the difference. Public broadcasting is now part of the bedrock of this society and should not be numbered among its endangered species. Yes we should experiment. Yes we should seek new sources of revenue but never at the risk of losing what we have. We must not tamper with the ideals and the principles of public broadcasting. We simply must not compromise this institution. Public broadcasting is no longer an experiment. It works and it can continue to work its fundamental mission is to bring programs of excellence to the public programmes of high quality unavailable anywhere else. Programmes which entertain educate and stimulate us and hopefully our children and hopefully their children. Excellence is its lodestar its constant guide. It can't always hit that mark it shouldn't be expected to. But we who know it and who support it can never lose sight of that goal. How then in these economically troubled times do we sustain these important activities. There are essentially two sources of income for Public Broadcasting in this nation.

    <div id="para11" class="para" data-timecodebegin="00:12:19.759" data-timecodeend="00:13:19.549">The first which provides about three quarters of all funding is the community of television and radio licensees. People like you who make it work within regulatory limits those licensees turn to the private sector to the foundation world to state and local government to educational institutions and to their audiences. The licensees engage in auctions benefits and a host of other enterprising activities to sustain their services. Without you and without others like you across this nation we would literally be without a noncommercial broadcasting service in this country. The other sources of income or the other source of income pardon me is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting whose duty as an independent entity is to nurture guide and invigorated Public Broadcasting.

Accordingly the federal commitment in my view is and will always be of singular importance. In fact I believe that the federal commitment to public broadcasting has been and will be one of the soundest uses of our national treasury both in terms of purpose and accomplishment. We are the only industrialized nation on the face of this globe which supports most of its efforts in noncommercial public broadcasting through local activity. All the other nations who are our allies support similar activities entirely through their national governments.

    <div id="para14" class="para" data-timecodebegin="00:14:21.509" data-timecodeend="00:21:07.440">Our accomplishments as you know are about to be sorely tested. Federal support is falling off our long range goal must be to strengthen that federal foundation and thereby strengthen our stations and our national operating institutions. Our immediate goal however must be to sustain ourselves. This year the one hundred seventy two million dollar federal appropriation the largest in our history is a benchmark in the history of public broadcasting. The nearly devastating irony is that were we more stable this benchmark could serve as a point of fulfillment in terms of the services we are now able to provide. And as a signal to the public of what is still to come instead. And unfortunately it is a benchmark which must serve as a resource to be used to get through these next years. For 1983 PBS appropriation drops to one hundred thirty seven million dollars for 1984 85 and 86. The congressional authorization level is one hundred thirty million dollars. And as you know we shall have to fight to maintain that level. In my view funding levels below one hundred thirty million dollars will severely jeopardize our ability to maintain current services. We have the cooperation will have enormous difficulty at that level in meeting costs associated with critical system support activities. Even at that level the maximum we can hope to achieve CPB is direct support to our stations will slip to one acceptably low levels and a commitment to high quality national programming will fall alarmingly below amounts needed to maintain and sustain those efforts. The American people have invested many many millions of dollars in public broadcasting to much I believe for them to see the dividends from that investment dwindle and perhaps vanish. We must assure all Americans that there is was and continues to be one of the wisest and most thoughtful investments they have ever made. We have already started to plan for long range financing solutions together. All of us across the nation must agree on the principles. Work together with the Congress provide information to those who still need to be convinced and inform everyone in Public Broadcasting's growing and vast family of what is needed and why it is needed. And most important you must intensify your efforts here at the community level as a first step in this process. We have established a new long range financing taskforce at the corporation with representatives from the public broadcasting community and the public like its highly successful counterparts several years ago. This task force will conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of financing alternatives and funding sources for Public Broadcasting. Our early year long range financing taskforce provided public broadcasting and the Congress with guidance which led to long range advance funding and matching federal support. Both very important ingredients in what must be a constant effort to insulate our enterprise from the federal government itself. This new task force represents an equally important undertaking within the next eight months a congressionally created temporary commission on alternative financing for public broadcasting must present to the Congress a plan for the financing of this institution. Frankly I am heartened by the very idea that the Congress for the first time wants to help us resolve our financial problems. If we too care we will be absolutely certain that a plan which puts in place a long range policy for the continuation of public broadcasting and a revenue base to support it is properly delivered by the temporary commission in mid 1982. To do that our own long range financing taskforce will begin its own work next month. We cannot at any cost negate the federal role while under 30 percent of the total cost it has been and will continue to be one of the two fundamental foundations of our resources. It is part of our pact with the American people. However the hard fact remains that for the next few years this source of support will be less than it should being. Accordingly we must begin to provide ways to seek alternative forms of financing. We have to look for other avenues to secure our income. And we must begin as we have begun across the country as part of its work the congressionally created temporary commission is examining an 18 month long experiment with cluster advertising for broadcast use on our air on our television stations and our radio stations. The public broadcasting community is a good faith participant in this advertising demonstration project. And of course we'll support the efforts of the temporary commission. I believe that the results of these investigations will prove invaluable to us to the Congress and to all the people of this land on air advertising however again in my view is not the answer for Public Broadcasting. Not now and probably not in the future. We have a unique service to offer to the American public a service which more and more people each year recognize and support and public broadcasting from its very first days developed and grew as a commercial free undertaking. The limited advertising experiment authorized by the Congress should be thoroughly explored because our needs are great but we must be very cautious. This experiment should not divert or delay us nor should it tire us from the actions we must take to be certain that this institution survives and prospers.

Let's assume that we are very successful with all of these efforts to learn and to establish openings to the commercial marketplace. Let's assume for a moment that we accomplish these ventures without damage to our public and our independent status without damage to our more traditional sources of support. The net proceeds as far as we can tell would very likely not add up to 10 percent of our current system operating budgets across the nation and they would probably not even equal 30 percent of the greatly reduced federal commitment.

Not unless the millions who watch and listen. Want a completely different institution. Many people believe in us and they give us their support. Many more are willing to help us and we you for our part must work for stronger understanding greater appreciation and increased support from all Americans. All the possible resources and energies of the corporation over the next 12 months will be bent to that end. Without the people we are nothing. We must deal with the whole question of a viable and enduring public policy for Public Broadcasting. We must speak with one voice a voice which is clear and understandable. A voice which is heard and a voice which is heeded. With such a unity in place Public Broadcasting can have an enduring congressional commitment a stable national policy which will enable continuing progress as you know both television and radio have increased listener and viewer support by significant numbers over the past 10 years. But we must have an even greater groundswell of support. The people here in Little Rock in Denver in St. Louis and in New York the people in communities across the country who want the kind of system which delivers the kind of service they want must join with us to get the kind of congressional commitment we simply must have. Then my friends and only then will be will be able with any certainty to experiment with new ways including commercial ways to strengthen our base. The message which goes to the policymakers in Washington. Let's go from you. We must begin to play and now for Long-Range financing which might be introduced two years from now. We must agree on the principles do the necessary work with our friends in Washington go out and do whatever missionary work is necessary to persuade others and to inform everyone and Public Broadcasting's of vast community of where it is we're going. I can't give you a timetable but to obtain the kind of long range funding we need at the national level to sustain what we are we must begin to work together now. I believe we can respond to that challenge together the stations in the cooperation can forge the institution. We have been charged to put in place then we can have an understandable public presence and identification. Then we can put in place once and forever a viable and continuing public policy which says this is an essential institution in this democracy. And this period of austerity and uncertainty there can be no place for equivocation or for dissembling. We must build an institution on trust on understanding and on commitment. There is no longer in my view a choice I should like to suggest three paths. The first is to strengthen the support of the American people. We must involve people more people in the listening and viewing public. The public who supports us with voluntary dollars through their states through their communities through wanting our membership drives that public must grow by at least one million people for television and 200000 people for radio. And those people must be in place by January 1984. We must persuade our nation that we are genuinely the people's business. Second we simply must have a longer range commitment from the United States Congress at least a 10 year commitment with the current forward funding principles in place. No longer can this institution have the need for public broadcasting questioned every two to four years. The mandate should be constant and enduring pact with our fellow citizens. Third we must probe because we have obligations and responsibilities and put in place certain openings to the commercial marketplace. But we must be careful not to endanger the noncommercial base of what we are and what we do. So we seek one in a quarter million new voluntary subscribers to public television and radio. We seek a firmer federal commitment and we are willing to test careful openings to possible commercial revenues. It can be done if we are together. Fifteen years ago when you began this great experiment here in Arkansas or would you have thought that you could have developed this kind of an enterprise with these kinds of services with these kinds of facilities. Fifteen years ago we were not even a trolley car. We were a horse and buggy and a jet age. Today the satellite system we have put in place is one of the wonders technological wonders of this nation's entire technological environment. We led the way into the satellite world. We didn't follow the commercial world is following us 15 years ago we dreamed about color transmission and about covering great cultural and public events across the world instantaneously.

A remarkable remarkable piece of artistic beauty supported by the people of every possible community. Is this going to be the generation that stops the construction of this cathedral as a father as a citizen and as a public broadcaster. I hope I do not have to carry that with me. The building here. Ladies and gentleman. It's not the only story of what Lee Reeves has done what Lee Reeves has done. It's going to be reflected by the next generation of AUK and sons who are in school rooms today and who are using this facility and its program services to improve their minds and their spirits.

Now I make no apologies for stories I may or may not tale can certainly raise but I just can't think. Senator Pryor all talking about Lee Reeves from a particularly governmental and state government standpoint without interjecting a story. So I think of want to immediately that is 180 degrees out from what we're doing here today but using it as an irony I'd like to relate the story to you about this lady that I met a gentleman on Saturday evening they spent the evening together got married later that same evening had their honeymoon and on Monday morning she was in the divorce court before the judge. Playing for a divorce and the judge says ah can't this be on me so I can understand if I have the facts right you met this this your husband on Saturday evening you married later that evening you've just come off your honeymoon it's Monday and you want a divorce. She says yes the judge asked Ryan about the quickest way I know to splain that is that he was the most over introduced man I ever met. Now I'm going to have to confess to you that in my capacity as a public official I do sometimes have to not story but I have to embellish the truth a little bit to give the kind of introduction to a person that that he wants to hear and I want to give or maybe write a letter of recommendation for a job some of that nature. But I will not regardless of what I might say today I will not be able to over introducer over a grand today. And the fact Linda he reminds me of another story and you know hey I can do this in all good conscience because Lee Reeves is a master storyteller. Those of you that have known him at all you know laugh. And he is somewhat like the husband of the wife that limited you never tell me you love me anymore. And he said look I told you that a lot of you when we got married if anything changes I'll let you know. Well those all of us in the audience would have had to run for office know the you know the feeling and camaraderie that we have with a man that doesn't have to keep proving to you that he's where he said he was and that's the kind of man that Lee Reeves is when he tells you something. That's the way it's got to be. In other words he's dependable if he tells you he's for you you don't have to go back the next day and say leave your still for make his pitch changes he'll tell you. And I appreciate that about him. Well I'm going to move on and not take up more time than I've been given. But I think that perhaps in a concrete way even more than the brick and mortar that we dedicate here today as a tribute to lead is the stat that Lee has compiled is put together.

It was my gracious host at a dinner in Cincinnati at the meeting of the PBS back in the fall and lighted to have him here with us. I also want to recognize our supervisor because of the particular structure of the state government. He has the wisdom to administer his department and leave us to administer our department. But we are very much cognizant of this support and assistance which we have received from the State Department of Education and Dr. John Roberts is here with us Commissioner of Education. I want to recognize two other people who have been important to us in constructing this facility and making it available. First of all from the architectural firm of Anderson Baker and MARTIN Mr. Joe Baker who was our principal architect. And the president of con Ark builders the contractor for the construction Mr. Bob Tyler. If he is here he may be checking the bricks are looking at the roof. One of the standing jokes that we have on the commission is one coach goes back long before I became a member. It seems that we had in this facility Dr. Smith is the primary responsible party for this he reports on it at every commission meeting. We had a leaky rough. I say Miss Hammond smiling about that. And that is a standing order of business on our agenda is that we always get a report on the roof. I'm pleased to say that our present contractor and architect have that sort of thing under control. And Senator Russ we'll only be back for about $150000 to help with a rough next year. We have come now to a part of the program which. Is of extreme personal privilege to me. I have served or will soon serve the general of allotted two years of chairmanship of this commission and it has been an extreme pleasure in so many ways that in the remaining 20 minutes or so that we have available for our programs but I can't tell you of all of them but working with starting from a position of not knowing too much about what educational television was about but anticipating somewhat the opportunities which it presented and indeed the challenges presented. I was pleased to be appointed to this commission and serve on it and work with Senator Russ alluded to the fact that he is a most responsive and responsible public servant. When we decided to dedicate the facility today to Lee and selected the title for it we had some concern because we know Lee's concerned with the expenditure of public monies. We selected a title which has several words in it among which are educational and telecommunications all of which are fairly long and when you start buying cast bronze or aluminum letters or so forth we recognize that getting Lee to agree to spend the money to put a sign on the building as he had been directed to by the commission may be a problem. Well temporarily only we have alleviated that problem by preparing a plaque which I want to present to Lee and I want his solemn assurance that it will be displayed publicly in a prominent place until we can get together and decide where we can get the money to do it in a more permanent and publicly recognizable way.
