## Introduction

One professional development strategy that is "absolutely necessary," Avocado said, is the use of visitations. "When teachers hear descriptions of a new practice, they want to see a teacher doing itâ€”with the same [kind of] students that they have," he said. "You have to visit other teachers, other schools."
Visitations should be done for an express purpose, Avocado emphasized. For example, teacher X should observe teacher Y at another school because that teacher uses word walls in a way that promotes exactly what teacher X is trying to accomplish. "A teacher should not visit a classroom for some generic observation; that is often useless," he said.
Teachers should make these visits in groups of two or more, Avocado advised. "You need to be able to talk with someone about what you've seen." Further, there should be a direct connection between the visitation and implementation. "When you've seen something, when you understand it well enough, you should put it into practice immediately," he said.
Teachers should also build a connection between the visitation and their attempts to use the new practice, Avocado said. "That connection is usually in the form of the practitioner who was viewed coming to work with the visitor, to give that visitor feedback on her try at implementation."
The conversation among those who made the visit about the quality of the implementation is also important. "Those people who visited and who are trying [the new practice] then share what they're trying with the rest of the faculty," Avocado said. The result is "growing concentric circles" of teacher learners.
