male narrator:
IN THE SUMMER OF 1957,

2
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:42,033
LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS,
WAS CONSIDERED

3
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,067
A MODERATE SOUTHERN CITY.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,667
THINGS WERE PRETTY NORMAL THERE

5
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:49,834
AS FAMILIES BEGAN TO PREPARE
FOR THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR.

6
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,334
HOWEVER, THE SHOCKING TRUTH

7
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,567
WAS THAT
THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE

8
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,801
HAD COME TO LITTLE ROCK'S
CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL.

9
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,701
PUZZLING IMAGES
OF THE ARKANSAS NATIONAL GUARD

10
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,534
CIRCLING THE SCHOOL,

11
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:05,100
THE LITTLE ROCK NINE BEING
BLOCKED FROM ENTRY,

12
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,300
ANGRY MOBS,

13
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,968
GOVERNOR FAUBUS MEETING
WITH PRESIDENT EISENHOWER,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,667
THE 101ST AIRBORNE.

15
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:16,501
THE DRAMA PLAYING OUT
WAS A GREAT NEWS STORY

16
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,634
FOR THE DEVELOPING
TELEVISION INDUSTRY

17
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:22,000
AND GREAT DRAMA
FOR ALL JOURNALISTS.

18
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,367
THE EVENTS IN LITTLE ROCK

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,501
CAPTURED THE COVER
OFTIMEMAGAZINE

20
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:29,567
IN SEPTEMBER
AND OCTOBER OF 1957.

21
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:33,000
AS THESE IMAGES AND HEADLINES
SPILLED INTO LIVING ROOMS

22
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:35,200
ACROSS AMERICA AND THE WORLD,

23
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,367
LITTLE ROCK HAD BECOME
THE BATTLEFIELD

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,634
FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

25
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,367
THE STORY OF THAT YEAR,
THE 1957, 1958 CRISIS

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,501
AT CENTRAL HIGH
IS WELL-DOCUMENTED.

27
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:48,467
WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU
OF ANOTHER STORY

28
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,968
OF LITTLE ROCK AND ITS PEOPLE,
THE FOLLOWING YEAR,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,734
OF THE LITTLE ROCK DESEGREGATION
CRISIS.

30
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:57,400
>> EVERYONE SEEMS TO KNOW
ABOUT 1957, '58,

31
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:00,567
BUT NEWCOMERS TO ARKANSAS
AND THOSE BEYOND OUR BORDERS

32
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,734
AND MANY WHO ARE YOUNG

33
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,868
HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF THE LOST YEAR.

34
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,167
narrator: YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,067
WITH THE PLIGHT
OF THE LITTLE ROCK NINE

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,601
AND THE STRUGGLES THAT YEAR
AT CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL.

37
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:20,033
YOU MAY, HOWEVER,
BE UNAWARE OF THE STORY

38
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:24,133
OF THE LOST YEAR OF 1958, 1959

39
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,434
WHEN GOVERNOR FAUBUS
AND HIS SUPPORTERS

40
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:30,067
WORKED TO STOP INTEGRATION AGAIN
AND SUCCEEDED

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,968
FOR AN ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
IN MAY OF 1958, ERNEST GREEN,

43
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,234
THE ONLY SENIOR
OF THE LITTLE ROCK NINE,

44
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:41,767
GRADUATED WITH HIS CLASS
FROM CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL.

45
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:44,501
FINALLY, THE CRISIS
AT CENTRAL HIGH WAS OVER,

46
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:48,334
AND THE PEOPLE OF LITTLE ROCK
BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.

47
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,000
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

48
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:53,367
>> AFTER THE YEAR
THAT THE LITTLE ROCK NINE

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,767
WENT TO CENTRAL
AND WE WERE AT HALL,

50
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,934
YOU KNOW, WE THOUGHT, WELL,

51
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,901
MAYBE NOW
WE'VE WEATHERED THE STORM

52
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:02,734
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO
HAVE LITTLE ROCK

53
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:06,000
BE IN THE BAD SPOTLIGHT ANYMORE.

54
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,300
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU KNOW, BAM.

55
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:09,334
IT HIT US AGAIN.

56
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,467
AND THE SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED,

57
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,234
AND IT WAS JUST
A TERRIBLE TIME.

58
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:15,100
>> THE SUMMER OF 1958

59
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,334
WE WERE EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD

60
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,667
TO OUR JUNIOR YEAR
AT HORACE MANN.

61
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,934
LITTLE DID WE KNOW

62
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:21,834
THAT THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE
A JUNIOR YEAR.

63
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,234
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE
WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO,

64
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,300
THE MANY ACTIVITIES,
THE JUNIOR-SENIOR PROM,

65
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,300
AND THINGS OF THAT SORT.

66
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,801
>> GOVERNOR FAUBUS
AND THE CITIZENS COUNCIL

67
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,901
AT THAT TIME
I THINK IT WAS CALLED,

68
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:38,534
THEIR AGENDA WAS NOT THE AGENDA
THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN.

69
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:41,534
>> AFTER HE MADE THE DECISION
TO DO WHAT HE DID

70
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:45,100
AT CENTRAL HIGH,
HIS POPULARITY JUST DOUBLED.

71
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,634
WE GOT MAIL BY THE TOE-SACKS
FULL IN SUPPORT OF HIM.

72
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,367
SO I THINK AT THAT POINT
HE REALIZED

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,868
THAT HE HAD A VERY GOOD CHANCE
TO WIN A THIRD TERM.

74
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,934
>> AFTER ORVAL FAUBUS WON HIS
THIRD NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR,

75
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:01,334
AND WITH THAT VOTE
OF 75 OUT OF 75 COUNTIES,

76
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:05,133
BASICALLY, THREE EVENTS
IN THE SUMMER OF 1958

77
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,767
THAT ALLOWED
THE LOST YEAR TO HAPPEN.

78
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,567
THE FIRST ONE
WAS THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD

79
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,167
HAD FILED FOR A DELAY.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,033
>> A NUMBER
OF BUSINESS LEADERS PERSUADED

81
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,501
A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD

82
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:19,434
THAT THEY OUGHT TO GO BACK
TO THE FEDERAL COURT

83
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,033
AND ASK FOR A DELAY.

84
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,334
>> AND IN FILING FOR THAT DELAY
IN COOPER V. AARON,

85
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:29,234
THEY REQUESTED A 2 1/2 YEAR
DELAY OF FURTHER INTEGRATION.

86
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,968
>> THEY HAD TRIED TO INTEGRATE.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,234
THEY HAD DEMONSTRATED

88
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,667
THAT IT WOULDN'T WORK
WITHOUT VIOLENCE

89
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,334
AND WITHOUT FEDERAL TROOPS
IN HERE

90
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,868
TO CONTROL THE SITUATION.

91
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:44,467
SO THEY SAID--THEY PETITIONED
THE FEDERAL JUDGE FOR A DELAY.

92
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:48,467
>> THE NAACP IMMEDIATELY
FOUGHT THAT DELAY.

93
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:52,834
AND THEN FINALLY FAUBUS' CALL
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN AUGUST

94
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,334
SET UP THE GROUNDWORK

95
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,000
FOR WHAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO
WITH THE SCHOOLS

96
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,834
IN THE YEAR OF '58, '59.

97
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,200
narrator: DURING THE LOST YEAR,

98
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,267
OVER 3,600 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS,
BOTH BLACK AND WHITE,

99
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,601
WERE LOCKED OUT
OF THEIR PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS.

100
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:09,400
TEACHERS UNDER CONTRACT
FACED EMPTY CLASSROOMS

101
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,934
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

102
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:15,300
>> IN MY MIND,
I THINK 95% OF THE STUDENTS,

103
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,767
POSSIBLY MORE THAN THAT,
WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL

104
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:22,267
AND JUST WANTED THIS THING
TO KIND OF GET OVER WITH

105
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,334
AND HOPEFULLY
THAT IT WOULD BLEND IN.

106
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,767
I THINK THERE WERE A VERY SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF THE STUDENTS

107
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:31,534
THAT DID NOT WANT
TO SEE THIS THROUGH AT ALL

108
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:34,467
AND DID NOT CARE IF THEY
RECEIVED THE EDUCATION OR NOT,

109
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,200
THEY WOULD HAVE
JUST AS SOON LEFT.

110
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,467
I DID NOT
FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.

111
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,467
>> THE BILLS THAT WERE PASSED
IN THE EXTRAORDINARY SESSION

112
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,734
OF THE SUMMER OF--
AUGUST OF 1958,

113
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,868
ALLOWED THE GOVERNOR
TO DO MANY THINGS.

114
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:51,133
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THAT HAD TO DO WITH US

115
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:55,200
WAS HIS ABILITY TO CLOSE SCHOOLS
THREATENED WITH INTEGRATION.

116
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,934
THE SECOND ONE
WAS ABOUT FINANCES.

117
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:02,100
AND IT ALLOWED STATE MONEY
TO FOLLOW A STUDENT

118
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,567
TO WHATEVER ACCREDITED SCHOOL
THEY CHOSE

119
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,234
SO THAT STATE TAX MONEY

120
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,534
COULD ACTUALLY FOLLOW A STUDENT
TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL

121
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,100
AS LONG AS IT WAS ACCREDITED.

122
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,367
AND PROBABLY
THE THIRD IMPORTANT ISSUE

123
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,667
WAS THAT
IT THREATENED TEACHERS ALREADY

124
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:21,267
IN THE SUMMER OF 1958

125
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,067
BY ASKING ALL THE TEACHERS

126
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,067
AND STATE EMPLOYEES
TO SIGN DOCUMENTS

127
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,300
THAT SAID THAT YOU MUST LIST

128
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,934
EVERY ORGANIZATION
TO WHICH YOU BELONG.

129
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:33,834
narrator: THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT

130
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,801
HAD MET ONLY THREE TIMES
IN ITS HISTORY

131
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,400
FOR A SPECIAL SESSION.

132
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:40,434
THE LOST YEAR CASE
WAS ONE OF THOSE THREE TIMES.

133
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:44,834
ON SEPTEMBER 12TH, IT ANNOUNCED
THAT INTEGRATION MUST PROCEED.

134
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:47,334
AND FAUBUS SWINGS INTO ACTION.

135
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,467
>> THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

136
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,033
AND THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
HAD OPENED.

137
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:53,100
THEY HAD OPENED
IN EARLY SEPTEMBER OF 1958.

138
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,033
BUT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
WERE DELAYED

139
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,534
BECAUSE OF THE COURT CASE.

140
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,834
WHEN THE FEDERAL COURTS SAY,
"GO FORWARD WITH INTEGRATION,"

141
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:03,267
FAUBUS TAKES THE 16 BILLS
THAT ARE ON HIS DESK;

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,234
HE'S WAITING--HE'S WAITING
FOR THIS COURT DECISION.

143
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,501
HE SIGNS INTO LAW THE 16 BILLS.

144
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:13,501
HE PHONES THE SUPERINTENDENT
OF THE SCHOOLS AND SAYS

145
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,200
ALL HIGH SCHOOLS IN LITTLE ROCK,
BLACK AND WHITE,

146
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,534
WILL NOT OPEN ON MONDAY.

147
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,133
THEY WILL NOT OPEN.

148
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:24,601
>> THERE WAS THIS SENSE OF
DESTRUCTION OF LIFE.

149
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:29,701
AND I OFTEN SAY THAT I
CONSIDERED WHAT ORVAL FAUBUS DID

150
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:32,901
TO BE A PERSONAL ATTACK ON ME.

151
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:34,801
THIS WASN'T JUST POLITICAL.

152
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,534
THIS WASN'T JUST SOCIAL.

153
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,100
THIS WAS AN ATTACK
ON IRVING SPITZBERG.

154
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:43,968
AND I SAW MY WHOLE LIFE
DISAPPEARING IN FRONT OF ME.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,767
narrator: THE FOUR HIGH SCHOOLS
IN LITTLE ROCK

156
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,200
THAT WERE CLOSED WERE:

157
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,501
CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL,

158
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,067
WHERE THE CRISIS BEGAN
THE YEAR BEFORE;

159
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,400
HALL HIGH SCHOOL,

160
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,834
A NEW HIGH SCHOOL
BUILT IN WEST LITTLE ROCK

161
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:56,267
FOR WHITE STUDENTS;

162
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,067
HORACE MANN HIGH SCHOOL,

163
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,234
A NEW HIGH SCHOOL
BUILT IN EAST LITTLE ROCK

164
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,634
FOR BLACK STUDENTS;

165
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,667
AND LITTLE ROCK
TECHNICAL SCHOOL,

166
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:06,968
A SMALL TECHNICAL SCHOOL
FOR WHITE MALES.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,567
>> IT WAS JUST
A STAGGERING BLOW TO ME.

168
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,901
IT WAS LIKE, "OH.
I MEAN, MY GOODNESS.

169
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,667
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?"

170
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:19,501
AND I FELT LIKE THAT THERE WAS
JUST NO HELP ANYWHERE.

171
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:24,701
THERE WAS NO 800 NUMBER TO CALL
AND GET ADVICE.

172
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,267
THERE WAS JUST NO HELP,

173
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,801
AND NO ONE, ACTUALLY NO ONE
REALLY KNEW WHAT TO DO.

174
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,300
narrator: ARKANSANS LOVE
THEIR FOOTBALL,

175
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,868
AND AS THE SCHOOL CLOSURES
HIT THE MEDIA,

176
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:40,000
THE PHONE STARTED RINGING
IN GOVERNOR FAUBUS' OFFICE.

177
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,934
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR SOMEONE
TO ASK THE INEVITABLE.

178
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:43,968
WAIT A MINUTE.

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,300
WHAT ABOUT FOOTBALL?

180
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,601
THE SCHEDULES WERE ALREADY SET.

181
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:50,200
AND SEVERAL OF THESE BOYS
WERE IN LINE FOR SCHOLARSHIPS

182
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:52,601
TO PLAY FOOTBALL IN COLLEGE.

183
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:55,100
>> THE LITTLE ROCK
CENTRAL TIGERS

184
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,767
WERE ARGUABLY
THE BEST FOOTBALL TEAM

185
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:00,067
IN THE NATION
FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD,

186
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,400
'57, '58 ESPECIALLY.

187
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:10,834
THEY HAD WON 33 GAMES IN A ROW
AT THE END OF MY JUNIOR YEAR,

188
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,767
WHICH WAS '57, '58,

189
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,501
AND AS WE ENTERED
OUR SENIOR YEAR,

190
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:18,000
WE WERE LOOKING VERY FORWARD
TO EXTENDING THAT RECORD.

191
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,601
>> FAUBUS ACTUALLY CALLED
VIRGIL BLOSSOM,

192
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:23,000
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS,
AND SAID,

193
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,133
"I WANT YOU
TO PUT BACK IN FOOTBALL."

194
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,434
AND, ACCORDING
TO VIRGIL BLOSSOM'S BOOK,

195
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,634
HE SAYS, "SO WE RESTORED
TO THE STUDENTS OF LITTLE ROCK

196
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,300
"FOOTBALL.

197
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:36,267
"NO CLASSES, NO ACADEMIC WORK,

198
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,067
ONLY FOOTBALL."

199
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
>> THE FOOTBALL TEAM BEGAN
PRACTICE ON AUGUST THE 20TH,

200
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,567
AS THEY ALWAYS DID.

201
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:46,767
AND WE PLAYED OUR FIRST GAME
WHICH WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE

202
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,133
BECAUSE THE STANDS WERE FULL

203
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,000
AND THE CHEERLEADERS
AND THE FANS

204
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,267
BUT SCHOOL HADN'T OPENED,

205
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,968
WHICH SEEMED VERY, VERY ODD.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,334
WE PLAYED OUR FIRST GAME,
AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK,

207
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,634
THE GAMES WERE CANCELLED.

208
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,067
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE ALL--

209
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,834
SEVERAL OF US
LOOKED AROUND AND THOUGHT, 

210
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:08,334
YOU KNOW, "SCHOOLS DON'T LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE GONNA OPEN.

211
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,634
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON."

212
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,934
SO WE MADE A--
WE BEGAN TO TRANSFER.

213
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,167
AND QUITE A NUMBER OF US,

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,267
SIX OR SEVEN THAT WERE STARTERS
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM,

215
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,467
TRANSFERRED
TO JACKSONVILLE HIGH SCHOOL.

216
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,033
BUT WE COULDN'T PLAY THERE
BECAUSE OF THE RULES

217
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,501
THAT YOU HAD TO
LIVE IN THE DISTRICT.

218
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,200
AND WE ALL FELT LIKE, WELL,

219
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,734
HALL HIGH WON'T DO VERY WELL
THIS YEAR IN FOOTBALL,

220
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,067
BUT AS IT TURNED OUT,

221
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,567
THEY WON
THE BIG NINE CHAMPIONSHIP

222
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,300
WITHOUT ALL OF US
IMPORTANT PLAYERS.

223
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:39,567
>> THE BAND MEMBERS, I REMEMBER,
THEY STILL ATTEND BAND PRACTICE,

224
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,667
AND THEY'D PRACTICE
OUT ON THE FIELD.

225
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:45,934
I REMEMBER
WHEN HORACE MANN'S BAND

226
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:50,767
PRACTICED ON CENTRAL HIGH'S
PRACTICE FIELD.

227
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,534
YOU KNOW, SO TO ME, THAT'S--

228
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,300
EVERYTHING WAS INTEGRATED
TO A DEGREE.

229
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:57,734
narrator: IT'S LATER
IN SEPTEMBER;

230
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,234
THE SCHOOLS ARE STILL CLOSED.

231
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,834
THE REFERENDUM VOTE IS COMING UP

232
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,834
TO DECIDE THE FATE
OF THE SCHOOLS.

233
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:05,400
AND THERE ARE ALL THESE
TEENAGERS AND THEIR FAMILIES

234
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,400
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

235
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,367
>> WELL, IN THE BEGINNING,
WHEN WE HEARD

236
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,901
THAT THE SCHOOLS
WERE GONNA BE CLOSED,

237
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:12,400
WE THOUGHT, WELL,
MAYBE FOR A DAY.

238
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:15,601
AND WE NEVER DREAMED
THAT IT COULD LAST A LONG TIME.

239
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,234
AND MY FATHER
WAS VERY, VERY ADAMANT

240
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,400
ABOUT THE SCHOOLS WILL OPEN,
AND THEY WILL OPEN SOON,

241
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,434
AND SO YOU'RE STAYING
RIGHT HERE.

242
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,801
>> AS FAR AS KNOWING
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

243
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,100
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

244
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,234
WELL, WE DID
GET WIND OF THINGS LIKE THAT,

245
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:34,167
BUT IT WAS,
"WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?"

246
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,367
THAT WAS MOSTLY
A QUESTION THAT WE ALL HAD.

247
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
narrator: AND WHAT WAS
THE SCHOOL BOARD DOING

248
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:40,868
ABOUT THE SITUATION?

249
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,067
>> THE SCHOOL BOARD
AT THAT TIME THOUGHT,

250
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,601
"WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING."

251
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,634
MAYBE THE VOTERS OF LITTLE ROCK
WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS

252
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,501
AND WE WILL HAVE SCHOOL OPENING.

253
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,868
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
IN THE MEANTIME?

254
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:57,501
SO THEY WORKED WITH THE THREE
BRAND-NEW TELEVISION STATIONS

255
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:00,234
TO PROVIDE TELEVISION TEACHING.

256
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,100
AND THEY HIRED--
THEY DIDN'T HIRE;

257
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,334
THEY PULLED 15 WHITE TEACHERS

258
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,801
TO GO DOWN
TO THE TELEVISION STATIONS

259
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,834
AND PRESENT LESSONS
ON THE BASIC CLASSES.

260
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:13,934
SO THE INTERESTING THING
ABOUT THAT

261
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:17,100
IS THAT ANY STUDENT
THAT HAD A TV

262
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,267
COULD WATCH THOSE LESSONS.

263
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,834
SO IT ALLOWED BOTH BLACKS
AND WHITES TO HAVE SCHOOLING.

264
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,834
THEY PUT TENTH GRADE
AT ONE STATION,

265
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,567
11TH GRADE AT ANOTHER STATION,

266
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,868
AND 12TH GRADE
AT ANOTHER STATION.

267
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:33,033
>> I THINK I WAS MORE SAD
ABOUT LEAVING THAN MAD.

268
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:34,834
THEN, I THINK
AS THE YEARS GO BY,

269
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,868
YOU KIND OF GET MAD THINKING
WHAT DID HAPPEN

270
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:41,868
AND HOW REALLY UNAWARE,
AS A 17-YEAR-OLD, I WAS.

271
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:49,334
>> I WAS NOT AS ATTUNED
TO POLITICAL ISSUES AT THAT AGE.

272
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,901
THOSE KIND OF ISSUES

273
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:54,200
WERE NOT REALLY
DISCUSSED WITH US AS TEENAGERS.

274
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:57,067
narrator: BY LAW, FAUBUS
HAD TO HOLD A REFERENDUM VOTE

275
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,701
WITHIN 30 DAYS
OF THE SCHOOL CLOSURES.

276
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:03,367
THE ELECTION WAS HELD ON
THE LAST SATURDAY IN SEPTEMBER.

277
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,367
BUT THE BALLOT
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

278
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,367
ABOUT THE HIGH SCHOOLS
BEING CLOSED.

279
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,267
THE VOTERS WERE ASKED TO VOTE
FOR OR AGAINST INTEGRATION.

280
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,934
>> THEY HAD TO ACTUALLY
VOTE FOR INTEGRATION

281
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,868
IN ORDER
TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN.

282
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:20,968
AND THE VOTE WAS 19,000-PLUS
AGAINST 7,000-PLUS.

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,100
AND THE 19,000-PLUS
KEPT THE SCHOOLS CLOSED

284
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,400
RATHER THAN
HAVE THEM INTEGRATED.

285
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:29,868
SO THE VOTERS
OF LITTLE ROCK RESPONDED

286
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,868
IN JUST THE WAY THAT
ORVAL FAUBUS EXPECTED THEM TO.

287
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:36,968
>> THE EXPERIENCE WAS,
THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE.

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,667
THE WORLD'S GONNA SEE
HOW TERRIBLE IT IS,

289
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,100
BUT ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME

290
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,267
ARE VOTING IN FAVOR OF IT.

291
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,701
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS WAS,
AGAIN, SURREAL

292
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,734
THAT ANYBODY COULD BELIEVE
WHAT THESE PEOPLE BELIEVED.

293
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,300
>> MY OPINION OF GOVERNOR FAUBUS

294
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:59,334
WAS PROBABLY DREADFULLY UNFAIR,
IN RETROSPECT,

295
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:03,200
BUT AT THE TIME,
I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS FAULT

296
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,133
THAT WE DID NOT HAVE
A SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

297
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,534
>> THE LITTLE ROCK NINE,
OF COURSE,

298
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,000
THIS AFFECTED THEM ALSO.

299
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:11,701
OF THE LITTLE ROCK NINE,
ERNEST GREEN HAD GRADUATED,

300
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:15,267
AND MISS TRICKEY
HAD BEEN EXPELLED

301
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,000
AND HAD MOVED TO NEW YORK
TO CONTINUE HER SCHOOLING THERE.

302
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:21,234
>> I WENT TO CENTRAL
IN GRADE 11,

303
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:26,601
WAS EXPELLED, AND LATER
WENT TO NEW YORK CITY TO SCHOOL,

304
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:29,767
BUT I CONSIDER THIS
PART OF MY LOST YEAR

305
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,033
BECAUSE IT'S THE AMERICAN
TRAGEDY.

306
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,501
>> SO THAT LEFT SEVEN
OF THE LITTLE ROCK NINE.

307
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,234
THEY, TOO, WERE LOCKED OUT
OF SCHOOL.

308
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,934
AND THEIR INTENTION--
SOME OF THEM

309
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:42,067
WERE INTENDING TO GO BACK
TO CENTRAL,

310
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,267
AND SO THEY TOO WERE LOCKED OUT
OF SCHOOL.

311
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,934
narrator: DURING THAT TIME
IN THE SOUTH,

312
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:50,067
SEPARATION OF THE RACES
WAS A WAY OF LIFE.

313
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,300
>> I CAN REMEMBER
BEING IN DOWNTOWN LITTLE ROCK

314
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:57,601
WITH MY MOTHER
AND PASSING BY A RESTAURANT

315
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,200
THAT HAD A BIG SALAD BOWL
IN THE WINDOW.

316
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,267
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT.

317
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,234
I WAS HUNGRY, AND I WANTED TO GO
INTO THAT RESTAURANT TO EAT.

318
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,934
AND SO I TOLD MY MOTHER
I WAS HUNGRY.

319
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:12,167
AND I SAID,
"THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

320
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,534
"I WANT SOME OF THE SALAD
THAT'S IN THE WINDOW,"

321
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,467
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE TOLD ME
THAT I COULDN'T GO THERE.

322
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,734
AND I SAID,
"BUT YOU GAVE ME SOME MONEY.

323
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,033
I HAVE SOME MONEY."

324
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,801
AND SHE SAID, "NO,
YOU CAN'T GO IN THAT RESTAURANT

325
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,734
BECAUSE YOU ARE BLACK."

326
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,801
>> I HAD BROUGHT
MY SCRAPBOOK WITH ME,

327
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,400
AND I WAS
GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS

328
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:35,534
TO MAKE SURE THAT
I WOULDN'T FORGET AND ALL THAT,

329
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,167
AND IN ONE OF
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT US,

330
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,033
ON THE BACK SIDE,
I TURNED IT OVER,

331
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,300
AND THERE WAS THE OBITUARY
FOR LITTLE ROCK.

332
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:46,067
AND IT DAWNED ON ME
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME

333
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,167
THERE'S THE OBITUARY,
BUT THEN ON THE SIDE,

334
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,133
IN LITTLE, SMALL ARTICLES,
IT SAID, "FUNERALS FOR NEGROES."

335
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,934
THEY WERE NOT EVEN INCLUDED
IN THE OBITUARY PAGE.

336
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,167
THEY HAD THEIR OWN LITTLE PLACE

337
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,267
WITH A LITTLE ARTICLE
THAT LARGE,

338
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,734
AND I NEVER KNEW THAT
TILL LAST NIGHT.

339
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,400
AND THAT'S THE SADNESS.

340
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:11,434
THAT'S WHAT
THEY HAD TO PUT UP WITH.

341
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,701
>> SEPARATION OF THE RACES
HAD EXISTED BY LAW,

342
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,234
LEGAL SEPARATION OF THE RACES,

343
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,868
SINCE THE LATE 1890s
IN ARKANSAS.

344
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,734
AND SO IT HAD BECOME
THE SYSTEM OF THE SOUTH,

345
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,200
THE JIM CROW SOUTH.

346
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,067
AND TO CHANGE ANYTHING

347
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,133
THAT INVASIVE
OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY

348
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,167
WOULD BE A SOCIAL, AN ECONOMIC,

349
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,067
EVERY KIND OF CHANGE
THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE.

350
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,701
SO WITH THE INTEGRATION
OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS

351
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:40,367
ENDORSED BY BROWN
VERSUS THE BOARD OF EDUCATION,

352
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,367
YOU WERE ASKING
THE COMMUNITIES OF THE SOUTH

353
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,767
TO CHANGE
THEIR ENTIRE LIFESTYLE.

354
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,100
narrator: ALL THE WHILE,

355
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,334
GOVERNOR FAUBUS
AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD A PLAN.

356
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,834
THEY WERE HOPING
TO CONVERT PUBLIC SCHOOLS

357
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:53,300
AND PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS

358
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:56,100
INTO A PRIVATE
SCHOOL CORPORATION.

359
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,968
>> IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THE ELECTION,

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,667
WHEN VOTERS VOTED
TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS CLOSED,

361
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,467
MAGICALLY WITHIN DAYS,
A LITTLE ROCK SCHOOL--

362
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,868
A PRIVATE
SCHOOL CORPORATION EMERGED.

363
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,868
THEIR PLAN WAS, ORIGINALLY,

364
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,734
TO LEASE
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS

365
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,701
AND HIRE
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS.

366
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,300
narrator:
AND THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS

367
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,133
WERE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS CONFLICT.

368
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,801
MANY WERE ASKED TO MOVE OVER

369
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,701
TO THE PRIVATE
SCHOOL CORPORATION

370
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,467
AND TEACH IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS
BEING FORMED.

371
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,567
>> JESS MATTHEWS CALLED
A FACULTY MEETING

372
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:28,834
DURING THE LOST YEAR

373
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:31,467
TO PRESENT TO TEACHERS
THE OPPORTUNITY

374
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,100
TO SIGN CONTRACTS TO TEACH

375
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:35,267
AT THE T.J. RANEY
PRIVATE SCHOOL.

376
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,000
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SIGN THAT CONTRACT.

377
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:42,634
I FELT VERY LOYAL
TO CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL

378
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,200
AND TO THE LITTLE ROCK
SCHOOL DISTRICT,

379
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,534
AND I DID NOT
SIGN THAT CONTRACT.

380
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,834
>> SOME OF THE TEACHERS
WHO SIGNED THE CONTRACTS

381
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,701
FELT THAT THEY HAD BEEN
COMPELLED TO DO SO,

382
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:52,968
THAT THEY HAD NO CHOICE,

383
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,567
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD
THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

384
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,567
WE CAN GET OUR STUDENTS
BACK IN SCHOOL.

385
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,534
YOU'LL BE IN THE SAME BUILDING
YOU'RE IN.

386
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,734
YOU'LL BE IN THE SAME CLASSROOM
YOU'RE IN.

387
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,868
YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME STUDENTS
THAT YOU HAD ASSIGNED TO YOU,

388
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,868
BUT YOU WILL BE TEACHING THEM

389
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,934
UNDER A PRIVATE
SCHOOL CORPORATION.

390
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:12,701
SO MANY OF THEM FELT COMFORTABLE
WITH SIGNING THAT DOCUMENT.

391
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:15,767
THE PLAN OF LEASING
PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS

392
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:18,434
TO PRIVATE SCHOOL CORPORATIONS

393
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:22,667
WOULD ALLOW FAUBUS
AND HIS SEGREGATIONIST FOLLOWERS

394
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,434
TO OPEN PRIVATE SCHOOLS,

395
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,734
AND THEREFORE THEY COULD
KEEP THEM SEGREGATED.

396
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,934
AND FAUBUS MADE A STATEMENT
ENDORSING THIS

397
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:34,267
USING AN 1875 LAW
ON THE BOOKS OF ARKANSAS

398
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,801
THAT ALLOWED THE LEASING
OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING

399
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,634
TO A PRIVATE ENTITY.

400
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,701
narrator: HOWEVER,
ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS

401
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,734
ABOUT LEASING
THE PRIVATE SCHOOL BUILDINGS

402
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,701
AND HIRING
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS

403
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,767
WERE SHORT-LIVED.

404
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,601
>> THAT 24-HOUR PERIOD

405
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:51,400
WAS SO EMOTIONALLY DRAINING
FOR TEACHERS.

406
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,300
THEY GO HOME,
THEY'RE ALREADY WORRIED

407
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,834
ABOUT THE DECISION
THAT THEY'VE MADE,

408
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,567
AND THEY HEAR
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR,

409
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:00,067
AND THE FEDERAL MARSHALL
IS SERVING THEM

410
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,567
WITH A RESTRAINING ORDER

411
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,901
THAT SAYS
YOU WILL TEACH FOR NO ONE.

412
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,901
YOU--AT THIS MOMENT,
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED,

413
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,133
THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED,

414
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,801
AND YOU WILL NOT
BE ABLE TO TEACH

415
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,767
FOR A PRIVATE
SCHOOL CORPORATION.

416
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,868
SO THERE WAS
A FEDERAL RESTRAINING ORDER,

417
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,634
AND THESE WERE DELIVERED
AT 10:00 AT NIGHT.

418
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,968
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS
WERE THEN PREVENTED

419
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,234
FROM SERVING
IN THOSE PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

420
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:26,767
>> WE HAD A HIGH REGARD
AND A RESPECT FOR HORACE MANN

421
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,767
BECAUSE WE FELT THAT WE HAD--

422
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,534
IT WAS PRETTY DIFFICULT

423
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:36,801
TO GET IN HORACE MANN
AND BE HIRED AS A BLACK TEACHER.

424
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,901
IF YOU WERE A GOOD
BLACK TEACHER,

425
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,434
IT WAS HARD FOR YOU
TO GET IN THERE.

426
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:42,067
>> THEY WERE UNDER CONTRACT.

427
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,534
AND EVENTUALLY
THE BUILDINGS DO OPEN AGAIN

428
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,167
AND PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS
GO TO WORK EVERY DAY.

429
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,868
THEY CLOCK IN EVERY DAY.

430
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,467
THEY KEEP THEIR SCHOOL HOURS
EVERY DAY.

431
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,901
narrator: NOW IT'S OCTOBER.

432
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:54,367
THE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED.

433
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,834
THE REFERENDUM VOTE
SEALED THE CLOSURES.

434
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,734
AND EVERYONE
IS BEGINNING TO BELIEVE

435
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,767
THE SCHOOLS WILL NOT REOPEN.

436
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,767
THE SCRAMBLE INTENSIFIES
TO FIND AN EDUCATION

437
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:06,434
FOR THE DISPLACED TEENAGERS
OF LITTLE ROCK.

438
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,934
>> I ENDED UP AT THE CONWAY
COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL

439
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:13,100
IN MENIFEE, ARKANSAS,
WHICH IS ABOUT 30 MILES.

440
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,267
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO LEAVE HOME.

441
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,734
I HAD NEVER BEEN AWAY FROM HOME

442
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,868
EXCEPT DURING THE WEEKEND
TO VISIT RELATIVES.

443
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,901
SO THIS WAS AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

444
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,667
I MISSED MY PARENTS,

445
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:29,567
I MISSED MY GRANDPARENT
WHO LIVED WITH US,

446
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:30,868
MY GRANDFATHER,

447
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,467
AND MY TWO SISTERS.

448
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,667
AND SO THIS WAS REALLY,
REALLY DIFFERENT.

449
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:38,400
THERE WERE NO OTHER CHILDREN
IN THE HOME THAT I LIVED IN.

450
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:40,267
>> IF A FAMILY HAD ONE CAR,

451
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,634
THAT WAS THE NORM
AT THIS TIME PERIOD,

452
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,400
AND WITH STAY-AT-HOME MOTHERS

453
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:46,701
AND PROBABLY
NOT A TWO-PARENT HOUSEHOLD,

454
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:51,367
HOW COULD A STUDENT
WHO WAS 15 YEARS OLD

455
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
GET TO A NEARBY PUBLIC SCHOOL?

456
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,501
>> IT WAS LIKE
SOMETHING OPENED UP,

457
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:57,701
AND WE ALL FELL IN IT.

458
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:01,000
KIDS HAD TO GO AWAY
TO RELATIVES' HOMES.

459
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:04,267
>> I WENT TO LIVE WITH AN AUNT
IN ST. LOUIS

460
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,801
TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION.

461
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:10,501
>> OUR VALUES AT THAT TIME
BASICALLY WAS FRIENDSHIPS.

462
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:11,868
WHEN WE ATTEND SCHOOL,

463
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:13,968
EVERYBODY WALKED
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER,

464
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,267
WE STUDIED TOGETHER,
WE ATE TOGETHER,

465
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
AND YOU PLAYED TOGETHER.

466
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:21,000
WHEN SCHOOLS CLOSED, OF COURSE,

467
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:25,567
IT BROKE A LOT OF THE
FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS

468
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,901
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS
MOVED AWAY.

469
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,501
THERE WERE SOME PARENTS
THAT WAS ABLE

470
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:32,200
TO GET THEIR KIDS
IN SCHOOLS IN OTHER STATES,

471
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,567
SO YOU DID LOSE A LOT
OF FRIENDS, CLOSE FRIENDS,

472
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:37,000
DURING THAT PERIOD THAT--

473
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:40,667
SOME YOU'VE SEEN SINCE
AND SOME YOU'VE NOT.

474
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,100
>> NORTH LITTLE ROCK
MADE THE DECISION IMMEDIATELY

475
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,167
THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT
NO STUDENT FROM LITTLE ROCK

476
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,734
UNLESS THEY CHANGED RESIDENCE.

477
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:51,300
>> PEOPLE SET UP BOGUS
RENTAL PLACES IN OTHER CITIES

478
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:53,300
SO THEIR KIDS
COULD GO TO SCHOOL THERE.

479
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,734
THAT HAPPENED
IN NORTH LITTLE ROCK.

480
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,334
THEY WOULD RENT APARTMENTS OVER
THERE AND USE THOSE ADDRESSES.

481
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:01,200
>> AND WHEN SCHOOLS DIDN'T OPEN

482
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,434
AND I STARTED THINKING

483
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,567
I'VE GOT TO
COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL SOMEHOW

484
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,634
IN ORDER TO GO TO COLLEGE.

485
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:11,434
I WENT DOWN
WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS.

486
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:14,801
WE WENT BY
THE MARINE CORPS RECRUITER,

487
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,367
AND HE WASN'T IN.

488
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,901
SO WE STOPPED
AT THE NAVY RECRUITER,

489
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:23,000
AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU WANT
TO GET AN EDUCATION,

490
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,334
I CAN GET YOU YOUR DIPLOMA."

491
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:29,100
narrator: PRIVATE SCHOOLS
BEGAN TO OPEN FOR WHITES.

492
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,300
T.J. RANEY HIGH SCHOOL.

493
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,067
>> STUDENTS FOUND
THAT IF THEY WERE GONNA

494
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,567
GO TO SCHOOL IN LITTLE ROCK
AND THEY WERE WHITE,

495
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,667
THEY COULD GO TO RANEY FOR FREE.

496
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:39,467
MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS
WOULD BE GOING TO RANEY.

497
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,934
THEY WOULD CHOOSE THAT SCHOOL.

498
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:45,534
>> AND AS FAR AS THE DECISION
TO GO TO RANEY,

499
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:48,901
IT WAS THERE; IT WAS CHEAP.
THERE WAS NO--

500
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,534
IT WAS LIKE A PUBLIC SCHOOL
ONLY PRIVATE.

501
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,067
I MEAN, THERE WAS NO FUNDS.

502
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
IT WASN'T LIKE THE BAPTIST HIGH

503
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,667
WHERE YOU HAD TO PAY TUITION
AND EVERYTHING.

504
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,334
WE WEREN'T POOR BY ANY MEANS,

505
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,501
BUT IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
THAT WAS NOT--

506
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:05,133
WE COULDN'T AFFORD
A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

507
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:09,234
>> ABOUT 800-PLUS STUDENTS
ATTENDED RANEY.

508
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:10,968
THEY DID GRADUATE A CLASS,

509
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
AND THEY DID RECEIVE
THEIR ACCREDITATION.

510
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,567
>> WE WAITED,
AND THEN THEY TOLD US

511
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:18,868
THAT THEY WERE GONNA OPEN
THE PRIVATE SCHOOL.

512
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:21,334
SO I GOT TO GO
TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOL,

513
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,801
WHICH I TRULY HAD--

514
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:27,434
I FEEL LIKE I WAS PROBABLY
ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES

515
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,767
BECAUSE I STILL WAS ABLE
TO GO TO SCHOOL

516
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:32,801
WITH A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
THAT I WENT TO CENTRAL,

517
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,968
AND THEN MY HALL FRIENDS
WERE BROUGHT BACK IN.

518
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,968
AND SO I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE
WITH SOME OF MY HALL FRIENDS.

519
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,868
>> IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR DR. RANEY

520
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,667
AND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE,

521
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE
DONE FOR MY SENIOR YEAR.

522
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,000
>> THE SECOND LARGEST
PRIVATE SCHOOL

523
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:50,334
THAT OPENED FOR WHITES
IN LITTLE ROCK WAS BAPTIST,

524
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,767
AND IT WAS OPERATED
UNDER THE AUSPICES

525
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:56,734
OF OUACHITA BAPTISTS
AND TWO DOWNTOWN CHURCHES.

526
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,834
THEY USED THE FACILITIES
OF THE SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH.

527
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:03,133
THEY USED THE YWCA
FOR THEIR P.E. CLASSES.

528
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,100
THEY USED
A BUSINESS SCHOOL DOWNTOWN

529
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,701
FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL CLASSES,

530
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,968
AND THEY HAD
BETWEEN 300 AND 400 STUDENTS.

531
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,267
>> THERE WERE SEVERAL
BOMB SCARES

532
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
THAT THE SCHOOL RECEIVED
DURING THE YEAR.

533
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,934
THE BOYS' CLUB WAS ACROSS
THE STREET FROM OUR SCHOOL,

534
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:20,934
AND WE WOULD GO
ACROSS THE STREET

535
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:23,667
AND SIT IN THE BOYS' CLUB

536
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:26,167
WHILE THEY WENT
THROUGH THE SCHOOL

537
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,701
CHECKING FOR ANY BOMBS.

538
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,234
NEVER FOUND ANYTHING,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

539
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:34,367
>> MOST OF OUR CLASSES WERE HELD
IN THE EDUCATIONAL BUILDING.

540
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,767
IT WAS A FAIRLY NEW FACILITY,

541
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,000
AND I MEAN, WE WERE
ALL OVER THAT BUILDING,

542
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:40,434
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

543
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:44,667
>> WHEN YOU CRAMMED 30 DESKS
INTO ONE OF THE CLASSROOMS

544
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:47,767
IN THE EDUCATIONAL BUILDING,
THEY WERE CRAMMED IN.

545
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,133
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER,

546
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:52,767
AND WE HAD ABOUT 30 STUDENTS
IN MOST OF OUR CLASSES.

547
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:56,000
THERE WERE NO WINDOWS
IN THE BUILDING WHATSOEVER.

548
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,067
>> BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WERE GOING TO BE IN LITTLE ROCK,

549
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,901
AND THE PARENTS TALKED
AND REALIZED

550
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,968
THAT CORRESPONDENCE COURSES

551
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,868
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
WERE AVAILABLE.

552
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:08,734
AND THERE WERE TEACHERS WHO
WOULD HELP WITH THOSE CLASSES.

553
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,767
MY CLASSES MET AT PULASKI
HEIGHTS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

554
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,968
IN THE AFTERNOON,

555
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,501
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT I KNEW

556
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:16,167
THAT WERE TAKING
THE SAME CLASSES.

557
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,267
YOU WERE IN A GROUP.

558
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,901
>> A LOT OF THE SENIORS--

559
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,767
NOT SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS--

560
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,734
THOUGHT IF THEY COULD
JUST GET AN ENGLISH CREDIT

561
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,300
OR MAYBE ONE MORE MATH CREDIT,

562
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,501
THEN THEY COULD GO ON
TO COLLEGE AT SEMESTER,

563
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,734
AND THIS WAS THE CASE
FOR MANY STUDENTS.

564
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,167
>> I'M ONE OF THESE STUDENTS
BACK THEN

565
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,067
THAT WENT TO ABOUT FIVE OR SIX
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS

566
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,267
IN FIVE OR SIX SUCCESSIVE YEARS.

567
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,934
I STARTED OUT,
WHEN I MOVED HERE,

568
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:41,801
AT FOREST HEIGHTS JUNIOR HIGH
FOR THE NINTH GRADE

569
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,200
AND THEN WENT TO CENTRAL--

570
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:46,934
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN '56, 57,
FOR MY SOPHOMORE YEAR.

571
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:49,000
THEN I WENT TO HALL
FOR MY JUNIOR YEAR,

572
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:51,434
WHICH WAS '57, '58.

573
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,367
AND THEN OF COURSE, '58, '59,
THERE WERE NO HIGH SCHOOLS,

574
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,801
SO I WENT AWAY,

575
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:59,234
AND I FINISHED UP AT ST. STEVENS
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.

576
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:04,534
>> MY DADDY TOOK ME
TO LOUISVILLE, ARKANSAS,

577
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:07,968
TO A COUSIN
THAT I HAD NEVER MET,

578
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,267
HAD NEVER BEEN
TO LOUISVILLE BEFORE,

579
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,534
AND WANTED ME
TO ENROLL IN SCHOOL THERE.

580
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,334
WELL, AFTER BEING THERE
TWO DAYS--

581
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:16,033
HE STAYED THERE WITH ME
TWO DAYS--

582
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:17,367
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

583
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,868
I WENT TO SEE THE SCHOOL,

584
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:21,968
AND IT'S LIKE,
"NO, I CAN'T DO THIS."

585
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,267
>> AND I WAS ON AN AIRPLANE
GOING TO KANSAS CITY

586
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,534
AND HARDLY REALIZED
WHAT HAD HAPPENED

587
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,367
UNTIL I GOT THERE
AND STARTED SCHOOL.

588
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,801
>> I GUESS PROBABLY THE SECOND,

589
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,767
MAYBE THE THIRD WEEK
IN SEPTEMBER

590
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:37,133
IS WHEN I ENROLLED IN
PULASKI COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL.

591
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,934
>> I WOKE UP
ONE SATURDAY MORNING

592
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:40,434
AND MOTHER AND DADDY CAME IN
AND SAID,

593
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,567
"GENIE, WE THINK WE'RE GONNA

594
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,100
"HAVE TO SEND YOU
AWAY TO SCHOOL.

595
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,868
AND YOU'RE LEAVING TOMORROW."

596
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:48,634
AND I WAS GOING, "GOODNESS."

597
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,400
AND SO IT WAS,
"TELL EVERYBODY GOOD-BYE."

598
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,801
REALLY, IT WAS A SHOCK.

599
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:56,133
>> THAT YEAR, I DID NOT GO
TO HIGH SCHOOL.

600
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:59,701
I STAYED OUT AND I WORKED
FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.

601
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:03,300
>> WHEN THE SCHOOLS
DID NOT OPEN,

602
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:06,033
MAYBE FOR THE FIRST WEEK,

603
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,634
MY MOTHER,
WHO WAS A RECENT WIDOW,

604
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:11,901
WE JUST ASSUMED
THAT THEY WOULD BE OPENING SOON.

605
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:15,801
SO FOR PROBABLY
ABOUT 2, 2 1/2 WEEKS,

606
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,534
WE SAT AND READ THE PAPER
AND WATCHED TV,

607
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,200
WATCHED THE EVENING NEWS.

608
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:25,434
AND LITTLE BY LITTLE,
I NOTICED THAT MY FRIENDS

609
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:27,868
AND CLOSE FRIENDS
WERE GOING AWAY.

610
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:30,100
THEIR PARENTS
WERE PUTTING THEM IN THE CAR

611
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,334
AND TAKING THEM
TO LIVE WITH RELATIVES,

612
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,200
PUTTING THEM IN COUNTY SCHOOLS.

613
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:37,167
SO AT THAT TIME,
MY MOTHER DECIDED TO TAKE

614
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,400
MY SISTER AND MYSELF
TO MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA.

615
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:43,234
>> IT HAPPENED THAT THE DAY
THAT WE SIGNED IN

616
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:47,467
WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE FIRST
SIX WEEKS OF THEIR SCHOOL.

617
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,667
EVERY CLASS I ATTENDED

618
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,501
TOLD ME THAT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE

619
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:55,234
MY FIRST SIX WEEKS' EXAMS
THE NEXT DAY.

620
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,868
I WAS TAKING ALGEBRA.

621
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:58,434
I HAD NEVER TAKEN ALGEBRA.

622
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,834
I WAS TAKING LATIN.

623
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:02,701
I HAD NOT TAKEN LATIN.

624
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:06,400
I WAS GONNA TAKE
SOME KIND OF ENGLISH EXAM

625
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,567
REGARDING A BOOK THAT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE READ.

626
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:11,767
EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE
FOREIGN TO ME.

627
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:14,434
SO MY SISTER AND I
MET AT LUNCHTIME,

628
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,367
DECIDED WE WOULD NOT BE BACK,

629
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,100
AND THE NEXT DAY, WE JUST DIDN'T
GO BACK TO SIDNEY LANIER.

630
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,367
SO AND THE REASON IS,
WE WOULD HAVE BOTH FAILED.

631
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,701
WE KNEW THAT.

632
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,734
WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT
GONNA BE A GOOD SITUATION.

633
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,501
>> SO WE STAYED IN MONTGOMERY,

634
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:31,267
AGAIN, WATCHING TV,
WATCHING THE EVENING NEWS,

635
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,667
SEEING OUR FRIENDS

636
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:37,167
TAKING A STAND,
WAITING FOR THE SCHOOLS TO OPEN,

637
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,367
AND FINALLY, WE PACKED IT UP
AND CAME BACK TO LITTLE ROCK.

638
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,100
narrator: HERE ARE SOME
OF THE STATISTICS

639
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,767
OF WHO WENT WHERE THAT YEAR.

640
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:46,968
>> 44% OF ALL THE WHITE STUDENTS

641
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,334
FOUND PRIVATE SCHOOLING
IN LITTLE ROCK

642
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:52,067
WHICH WAS A GREAT BONUS
AND BOON FOR THEM.

643
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,434
35% WENT TO OTHER
STATE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

644
00:28:56,467 --> 00:29:00,167
9% WENT TO PUBLIC
OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS OUT OF STATE.

645
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,234
4% ENTERED COLLEGE EARLY.

646
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:07,501
AND ALL BUT 7% OF WHITE STUDENTS

647
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:09,267
FOUND SOME PLACE
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

648
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,801
THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
THEIR CHOICE.

649
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,701
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
THE EDUCATION

650
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:15,467
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED
AT CENTRAL HIGH OR HALL HIGH.

651
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:18,634
BUT THEY WENT SOMEWHERE
TO SCHOOL, ALL BUT 7%.

652
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,868
narrator: BUT THE BLACK CHILDREN
WERE NOT AS FORTUNATE.

653
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,467
ONLY 50% OF THEM
FOUND A SCHOOL TO ATTEND.

654
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,667
>> OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
IN THE STATE, 36%--

655
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,767
THAT'S EVEN MORE THAN WHITES--

656
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:32,133
WENT TO NEARBY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
OR MOVED IN WITH RELATIVES

657
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,167
OR FOUND A PUBLIC SCHOOL
TO ATTEND.

658
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,567
12% WERE ABLE TO GO TO PUBLIC
OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS OUT OF STATE.

659
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:40,567
ONLY, I THINK, A TOTAL OF SIX
OF THE BLACK STUDENTS

660
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:42,567
WERE ABLE
TO ENTER COLLEGE EARLY.

661
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:45,901
>> I WAS GOING TO BE
IN THE TENTH GRADE,

662
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:51,267
AND I WAS GOING TO HORACE MANN
HIGH SCHOOL.

663
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,033
AND I ENDED UP GOING
TO J.C. COOK HIGH SCHOOL,

664
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,000
WHICH WAS
IN WRIGHTSVILLE, ARKANSAS.

665
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:03,000
>> AND I HAD TO GO
TO ST. PETERS IN PINE BLUFF,

666
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,467
WHICH WAS A PRIVATE
CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

667
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,033
>> DURING THAT TIME SPAN
THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED,

668
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,501
IT WAS VERY,
VERY HEARTBREAKING TO ME,

669
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:15,067
BECAUSE I HAD AN ASPIRATION
OF BECOMING AN ATTORNEY.

670
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,834
I REALLY WANTED TO GO INTO LAW.

671
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:21,100
THE BEST THAT I COULD DO
WAS TO WORK WHEN I COULD,

672
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,634
AND BEING A YOUNG CHILD,

673
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,300
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S VERY LITTLE
WORK YOU CAN DO

674
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,701
OTHER THAN TO CUT YARDS.

675
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:31,133
>> 50% OF BLACK STUDENTS
FOUND NO SCHOOLING

676
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,767
BECAUSE NO PRIVATE EDUCATION
FOR BLACKS

677
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,701
EMERGED IN LITTLE ROCK.

678
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,601
narrator:
A QUOTE FROM ROY WILKINS,

679
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:41,501
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NAACP,
EXPLAINS WHY.

680
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:42,534
>> "THE SEGREGATIONISTS

681
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,267
"HAVE SET UP
THEIR TEMPORARY SCHOOLS

682
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,634
"TO DEFY THE LAW.

683
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,534
"IF WE JOIN THEM
AND SET UP OUR SCHOOLS,

684
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:49,434
"WE WILL BE
DEFYING THE LAW ALSO.

685
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:53,067
"BESIDES, WE WOULD BE DOING
JUST WHAT THEY WANT US TO DO.

686
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,534
"IN ADDITION, WE WOULD BE
SELLING OUT THE YOUNGSTERS

687
00:30:56,567 --> 00:31:00,267
"WHO ENDURED THE PERSECUTION
AT CENTRAL HIGH LAST YEAR.

688
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,234
"WE WOULD BE BETRAYING
ALL OTHER NEGRO CHILDREN

689
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:04,701
"THROUGHOUT THE NATION

690
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:08,000
WHO HOPE TO GO FORWARD
TO FULL OPPORTUNITY."

691
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,801
narrator: WHAT WERE
THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES

692
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,601
THINKING ABOUT
THE CLOSED SCHOOLS?

693
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:14,567
DID THEY HAVE THE SAME STRONG
OPPOSITION TO INTEGRATION

694
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:16,467
AS DID THEIR PARENTS'
GENERATION?

695
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:21,601
>> I WAS NEVER INVOLVED
IN ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES

696
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:25,734
THAT I THOUGHT
WERE NEGATIVE SITUATIONS

697
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:29,634
WITH SOME OF THE BLACK PEOPLE
THAT HAD COME TO CENTRAL.

698
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,634
THEY WEREN'T
IN ANY OF MY CLASSES, WHICH--

699
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:33,968
IT JUST HAPPENED THAT WAY.

700
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,067
IT WASN'T, YOU KNOW, BY CHOICE.

701
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,734
AND I, FRANKLY, DIDN'T MIND
THAT THEY WERE THERE.

702
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,167
I THOUGHT WE COULD--

703
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,701
IT WAS A HUGE SCHOOL.

704
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,868
WE HAD LOTS OF STUDENTS.

705
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:47,133
YOU KNOW, A FEW MORE,
IT DIDN'T MATTER.

706
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,834
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD INTERFERE

707
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,467
WITH OUR EDUCATION AT ALL.

708
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:52,000
AND IT WAS OKAY WITH ME.

709
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,334
>> IN SEPTEMBER OF 1958,

710
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,467
WHEN THE SCHOOLS
HAD REMAINED CLOSED

711
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,400
AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OPEN,

712
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:01,834
THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES
TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES

713
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:03,167
TO MAIL OUT POSTCARDS.

714
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,701
AND STUDENTS AT CENTRAL
AND AT HALL

715
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,000
MAILED OUT POSTCARDS ASKING THEM

716
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:11,200
HOW THEY FAVORED
OPENING THE SCHOOLS

717
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,968
EVEN WITH INTEGRATION.

718
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,400
AND 71% OF THE STUDENTS AT HALL
SAID YES.

719
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,334
AND THE VOTE WAS ALSO FAVORABLE
AT CENTRAL.

720
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:25,367
THIS TELLS US THAT 18-YEAR-OLDS
COULDN'T VOTE IN THE 1950s.

721
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,234
SO THERE--PERHAPS OUR STUDENTS,
OUR CHILDREN

722
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:30,200
WERE MORE ENLIGHTENED
THAN THEIR PARENTS.

723
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:33,434
PERHAPS THEY REPRESENTED
A NEW THOUGHT,

724
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,567
A NEW WAY OF THINKING.

725
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:38,067
>> I WAS MAD BACK THEN.

726
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,767
I WAS MAD MAINLY AT THE PARENTS
AND THE STUDENTS

727
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:52,033
WHO WERE RECEIVING
ALL OF THE ATTENTION

728
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,868
AND MADE THE REST OF US SUFFER.

729
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:57,367
>> I NEVER WORRIED
ABOUT INTEGRATION.

730
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,167
AND I THINK
THAT IF THEY HAD OFFERED--

731
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,968
ESPECIALLY THE SENIORS
THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE,

732
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY

733
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:07,234
IN FAVOR OF OPENING THE SCHOOLS.

734
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,133
INTEGRATION WAS
NOT REALLY A PROBLEM

735
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,901
WITH THE GREATEST MAJORITY
OF THEM.

736
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,300
I'VE SAID MANY, MANY TIMES

737
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:16,734
THAT IF THEY HAD EXPELLED
ABOUT TWO DOZEN KIDS,

738
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,334
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE
NEEDED THE NATIONAL GUARD THERE.

739
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:22,100
>> YOU LIKE TO THINK
THAT THOSE WERE THE AGITATORS.

740
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,968
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK

741
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,234
THOSE WERE THE MAINSTREAM
STUDENTS AT CENTRAL.

742
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:27,834
THOSE WERE NOT THE LEADERS.

743
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:32,901
THOSE WERE NOT THE REALLY NORMAL

744
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:35,634
GOOD KIDS
WHO WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.

745
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:39,367
narrator: BUT THE 1958, '59
SCHOOL YEAR WAS TICKING AWAY,

746
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,734
AND MANY STUDENTS STILL HADN'T
FOUND A SCHOOL TO ATTEND.

747
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,901
>> I WAS GOING TO LITTLE ROCK
CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL

748
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:50,234
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A SENIOR
THE NEXT--IN THE '58 FALL,

749
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:51,868
AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

750
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,033
AND WE JUST SAT AND WAITED
AND WAITED AND WAITED.

751
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:58,234
SO THE FIRST OF OCTOBER,
I WENT TO DE QUEEN.

752
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:00,868
>> YOU CAN IMAGINE PARENTS
ON THE PHONE,

753
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,367
STUDENTS ON THE PHONE,

754
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,701
"I WANT TO GO
WHERE MY FRIEND IS GOING."

755
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,501
THEY DROVE TO JACKSONVILLE.

756
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:11,601
THEY HAD CARPOOLS TO MAPLEVILLE.

757
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,534
THEY HAD CARPOOLS
TO NEARBY SCHOOLS

758
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:15,968
SO THAT THOSE STUDENTS
COULD STAY AT HOME,

759
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,367
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY REACHED
THEIR TOTAL ENROLLMENT

760
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,501
AND COULD NOT
TAKE ANY MORE STUDENTS.

761
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:23,267
THE LONGER YOU WAITED,
THE MORE--

762
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,133
THE GREATER THE DISTANCE
YOU HAD TO GO TO FIND A SCHOOL.

763
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:30,534
>> WELL, WE HARDLY HAD A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

764
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:34,667
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY
WAS MAKING PLANS

765
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:39,767
AND HAD TO DO THEM RATHER
QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY PREPLANNING.

766
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:42,667
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE,
"OKAY, WE'RE IN A CRISIS.

767
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,100
"WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

768
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,868
HOW CAN WE GET THROUGH THIS?"

769
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:49,100
>> MOST OF THE STUDENTS
WHO DID MOVE IN WITH RELATIVES

770
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:52,734
DID NOT MAKE THAT MOVE
UNTIL, SAY, OCTOBER,

771
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:54,067
AS LATE AS OCTOBER.

772
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,501
SOME DID NOT EVEN GO
THE WHOLE FIRST SEMESTER,

773
00:34:56,534 --> 00:35:00,400
BUT BY SEMESTER, MANY PARENTS
HAD MADE THE DECISION

774
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:03,033
THAT IT WAS BETTER
TO SEND THEIR 15-YEAR-OLD CHILD

775
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,300
OFF TO A RESIDENTIAL HIGH SCHOOL

776
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:08,100
THAN TO LET THEM
NOT GO TO SCHOOL AT ALL.

777
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,367
>> SECOND SEMESTER STARTED.

778
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,634
I WENT TO HARDING ACADEMY,

779
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,567
WHICH IS A CHURCH OF CHRIST
BOARDING SCHOOL.

780
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:16,601
IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING
EXPERIENCE FOR ME

781
00:35:16,634 --> 00:35:18,868
AND A VERY EYE-OPENING
EXPERIENCE FOR ME

782
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:23,634
BECAUSE I'M JEWISH,
AND IT IS CHURCH OF CHRIST.

783
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,834
narrator: THE SEGREGATIONISTS
WERE WELL-ORGANIZED

784
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:27,767
WITH THE CAPITAL CITIZENS'
COUNCIL

785
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,934
AND THE CENTRAL HIGH
MOTHERS' LEAGUE.

786
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,667
>> SOME GROUPS ALREADY EXISTED
THAT WERE LEFT OVER

787
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:35,634
FROM EARLIER--FROM THE BEGINNING
OF INTEGRATION

788
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,968
OR COURT-IMPLEMENTED
INTEGRATION.

789
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,467
THE CAPITAL CITIZENS' COUNCIL
WAS A WHITE CITIZENS' COUNCIL

790
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:46,300
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR
IN ALL OF THIS IN LITTLE ROCK.

791
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,834
AND THEY HAD HELPED
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

792
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:50,901
TO COME OUT AROUND CENTRAL HIGH
AND PROTEST.

793
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:54,133
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
HAPPENED BETWEEN '54 AND '57

794
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:57,133
IS THE ORGANIZATION OF THESE
WHITE CITIZEN COUNCILS.

795
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,300
AND WHILE THEY REPRESENT,
MEMBERSHIP-WISE,

796
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,400
A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF POPULATION,

797
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:03,467
THEY GET THE ATTENTION
IN THE PRESS

798
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:05,701
THAT CAUSES LOTS OF ATTENTION
TO GO OUT.

799
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:08,901
AND COMMON ORDINARY FOLK

800
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,634
WHO ARE NOT GOING
TO JOIN THE COUNCIL

801
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,801
BUT SEE THIS
AS GIVING VOICE TO MAYBE

802
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:15,434
THEIR DEEPEST INNER FEELINGS
ALONG THE WAY.

803
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,667
>> WE GOT THE WORD

804
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,467
FROM SOME OF THE WHITE CITIZENS'
COUNCIL PEOPLE

805
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,834
THAT THEY WERE BRINGING A LOAD.

806
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,000
THEY WERE COMING IN.

807
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:23,834
THEY WERE GONNA STOP IT
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

808
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:27,834
AND GOVERNOR FAUBUS
WAS FACED WITH THAT PROSPECT

809
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,801
OF HAVING PEOPLE HURT OR KILLED.

810
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,467
HE DIDN'T WANT THAT.

811
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:33,501
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE EVER
CLOSED THE SCHOOLS

812
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,067
IF HE'D THOUGHT
IT COULD BE PEACEFUL.

813
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,133
>> WAS THERE REALLY
GOING TO BE RIOTING

814
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:42,234
AND KNIFINGS AND KILLINGS AND--

815
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,534
WAS THAT REALLY GOING TO OCCUR?

816
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,701
AND WE FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE

817
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:52,033
THAT THERE WAS A THREAT
SO STRONG.

818
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:55,467
>> ANOTHER GROUP
OF WHITE SEGREGATIONISTS

819
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:58,234
WAS THE MOTHERS' LEAGUE
OF CENTRAL HIGH.

820
00:36:58,267 --> 00:36:59,534
THEY CLAIMED TO BE A GROUP

821
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:03,000
THAT WANTED TO PREVENT
INTEGRATION AT CENTRAL.

822
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:04,300
SO THEY HAD BEEN AROUND

823
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:08,234
AND HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE
SINCE 1957.

824
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,901
THESE GROUPS ARE WORKING
IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.

825
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:14,834
THEY ARE PUTTING OUT THE WORD.

826
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:16,400
THEY ARE GETTING PRESS.

827
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,133
THEY ARE MAKING TELEPHONE CALLS.

828
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:22,167
THEY ARE DOING THEIR WORK
TO INFLUENCE ANY ELECTION

829
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,734
THAT WOULD OCCUR
IN THE LOST YEAR IN LITTLE ROCK.

830
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:26,701
YOU WILL HEAR ME SAY
SEGREGATIONIST,

831
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,968
BUT YOU NEVER HEAR ME SAY
INTEGRATIONIST.

832
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,767
AND THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WERE
SO FEW TRUE INTEGRATIONISTS.

833
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:36,400
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE
COMMUNITY WHO WERE MODERATES

834
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:39,334
WHO WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT
TOKEN INTEGRATION

835
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:41,033
AND FOLLOW THE LETTER OF THE LAW

836
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,667
AND TO FOLLOW
THE COURT DIRECTIVE

837
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:46,067
AND TO GRADUALLY MOVE TOWARD
INTEGRATION OF THE RACES,

838
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,901
BUT WHOLESALE INTEGRATION
WAS NOT TO COME IN THE SOUTH

839
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:55,467
IN ARKANSAS, IN LITTLE ROCK,
UNTIL BUSING IN THE 1970s.

840
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,701
SO WE'RE BACK IN THE 1950s,

841
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:02,300
AND TO EVEN MAKE TOKEN
INTEGRATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

842
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,934
WAS AN ENORMOUS CHANGE.

843
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:07,067
narrator: THE ONE LONE,
STRONG, AND COURAGEOUS VOICE

844
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,467
OF THE MODERATES EMERGED

845
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:11,667
AS THE WOMEN'S EMERGENCY
COMMITTEE TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS.

846
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:13,000
THESE WERE WHITE WOMEN

847
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:15,000
WHO BEGAN
WORKING ON THE NEW CRISIS

848
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:16,868
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

849
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:20,501
>> I JUST DID A TALK ON
ADOLPHINE FLETCHER TERRY.

850
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:23,267
SHE CALLED OUT THE WOMEN
AFTER TELLING, I THINK,

851
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,033
HARRY ASHMORE,
WHO WAS THE EDITOR

852
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:27,868
OF THE EDITORIAL PAGE
AT THEARKANSAS GAZETTETHAT,

853
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,267
"THE MEN HAVE FAILED US AGAIN.

854
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,667
IT'S TIME
TO CALL OUT THE LADIES."

855
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,133
AND THAT WAS THE INCEPTION

856
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,734
OF THE WOMEN'S
EMERGENCY COMMITTEE

857
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:38,400
TO OPEN THE SCHOOLS,
WHICH THEY DID.

858
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:39,934
>> WENT TO THE MEETING

859
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:42,167
THAT WAS BEING CALLED
OVER AT MRS. TERRY'S,

860
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,000
AND I WAS IMMEDIATELY
PUT TO WORK

861
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,667
SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY
YOUNG ONE THERE.

862
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:51,400
AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO HAVE A SITTER

863
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:53,434
BECAUSE I HAD
ALL THESE CHILDREN--

864
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:54,868
AT THAT TIME, I ONLY HAD FOUR,

865
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:57,868
BUT I HAD DECIDED THAT
I'D DRIVE A CAR FOR 13 YEARS

866
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,234
IF I COULD HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO WOULD BABY-SIT

867
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:03,033
AND SO THAT I COULD CONTINUE
WITH MY ACTIVITIES.

868
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:04,934
I DIDN'T WORK, BUT--
AND IT WAS JUST, LIKE,

869
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,234
A HALF A DAY THING,
BUT STILL.

870
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:08,701
THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
ANY OFFICERS AT THAT TIME,

871
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:12,133
BUT IT WAS--
BE IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.

872
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,300
>> THEY FORMED A GROUP
WITH THE INTENTION

873
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:16,334
OF OPENING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

874
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,267
AND THEY ACTUALLY TRIED TO,
IN THEIR PUBLICITY,

875
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,701
DISTANCE THEMSELVES
FROM THE IDEA

876
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,834
OF EITHER INTEGRATION
OR SEGREGATION AND SIMPLY SAY,

877
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:28,200
"WE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE TRYING
TO OPEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

878
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:30,267
FOR EVERYONE."

879
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,167
>> I WAS JUST REALLY,
REALLY SURPRISED

880
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,834
AND PARTICULARLY SURPRISED
AT THE CHURCH PEOPLE

881
00:39:34,868 --> 00:39:40,534
WHO HAD HAD THE SAME KIND
OF TEACHINGS THAT I HAD HAD

882
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:43,901
AND HOW THEY COULD BE
SO HYPOCRITICAL

883
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,567
AS TO HAVE, ALL THOSE YEARS,

884
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:49,501
ACTED AS IF
THEY BELIEVED THOSE THINGS,

885
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:53,501
AND THEY HAD NOT EVER EXPRESSED
"EVERYBODY BUT."

886
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,334
>> THERE WAS NO OTHER
PUBLIC VOICE

887
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:58,367
EXCEPT THESE
VERY COURAGEOUS WOMEN.

888
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,501
>> BY THIS TIME, OF COURSE,
I'D READ ENOUGH,

889
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:06,601
AND I KNEW ABOUT HATRED,
BUT IT DIDN'T--

890
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:08,634
I THOUGHT THOSE
WERE THE UGLY PEOPLE.

891
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,734
>> THERE WAS A MODEL BY THE TIME
OF THE LOST YEAR

892
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:16,000
THAT YOUNG, OLD,
WHATEVER, BUSINESSMEN

893
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:17,367
DID NOT SPEAK OUT.

894
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,133
NOW, THAT IS NOT TO SAY
THAT IN THEIR PERSONAL HOMES

895
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,834
THEY DID NOT
ENCOURAGE THEIR WIVES

896
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:24,133
TO JOIN
THE WOMEN'S EMERGENCY COMMITTEE

897
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,968
OR TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES.

898
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,133
PUT YOURSELF IN THE SEAT
OF A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER.

899
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,968
THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE TOLD YOU

900
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,968
THAT YOU MUST
INTEGRATE YOUR SCHOOL

901
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,834
AND FOLLOW WITH THE INTEGRATION
PLAN THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED.

902
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:39,601
THE STATE AND YOUR GOVERNOR
ARE TELLING YOU THAT YOU CANNOT,

903
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:43,033
AND THEY HAVE INTERVENED
BY PASSING A LAW

904
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,701
TO CLOSE THE VERY SCHOOLS

905
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,701
THAT YOU HAVE AGREED
TO INTEGRATE

906
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:48,934
AND TO CLOSE
ALL OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS.

907
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,501
THEY WERE FRUSTRATED,

908
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,100
THEY WERE TARGETED BY PEOPLE

909
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:54,734
WHO DID NOT APPROVE
OF WHAT THEY HAD TRIED TO DO,

910
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:59,734
AND THEY WERE--ONE OF THEM
HAS A QUOTE THAT SAID,

911
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,467
"IT WAS A HELPLESS
AND HOPELESS SITUATION.

912
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,100
"WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE.

913
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,701
OUR HANDS ARE TIED."

914
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:08,300
AND SO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL BOARD
RESIGNED.

915
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,100
narrator: ANOTHER INTERESTING
EVENT OCCURRED ABOUT THIS TIME.

916
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:13,901
A POPULAR MODERATE CONGRESSMAN,
BROOKS HAYS,

917
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:16,634
WAS UNSEATED BY ONE
OF THE REIGNING SEGREGATIONISTS

918
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,367
ON THE SCHOOL BOARD,
DR. DALE ALFORD.

919
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,868
>> BROOKS HAYS
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE,

920
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:25,234
I THINK, OF AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO DID STAND ABOVE THE NORM

921
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:27,968
AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK
TO OUR BEST INTEREST.

922
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,701
BUT HE ALSO WAS DEFEATED.

923
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:32,367
AND, YOU KNOW, HE COMMITTED
POLITICAL SUICIDE IN DOING THAT.

924
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,567
>> SO THERE HAD TO BE
AN ELECTION IN DECEMBER

925
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:37,467
OF A COMPLETELY NEW
SCHOOL BOARD.

926
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:40,567
ONE HAD GONE TO CONGRESS,
AND THE OTHERS HAD RESIGNED.

927
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:44,000
AND SO THIS IS A CHANCE
FOR THE PARENTS

928
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,667
AND THE POWERS THAT BE,

929
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:49,868
THE SEGREGATIONIST GROUPS
AND THE MORE MODERATE GROUPS,

930
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:53,300
TO PUT THEIR POWER
INTO AN ELECTION.

931
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:54,934
narrator:
AND AFTER A STRONG FIGHT

932
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:57,133
BY BOTH THE SEGREGATIONISTS
AND THE MODERATES,

933
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,167
THE NEW SCHOOL BOARD
WAS ELECTED.

934
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,801
IT WAS A THREE TO THREE SPLIT:

935
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:03,167
THREE MODERATES,
THREE SEGREGATIONISTS.

936
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,267
MEANWHILE, WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TO ALL THESE EDUCATORS

937
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,167
UNDER CONTRACT
TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM?

938
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,067
>> THERE WERE 177 TEACHERS
AND ADMINISTRATORS

939
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,067
WHO WERE LOCKED IN
TO THEIR BUILDINGS.

940
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,501
>> SOME OF THE TEACHERS
WOULD TELL US

941
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,167
IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
AND JUNIOR HIGH,

942
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,734
"Y'ALL OVER THERE
ARE DOING NOTHING."

943
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,000
BUT WE WERE NOT.

944
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:21,467
WITH THE CLASSES
WAS FORMED AT FIRST,

945
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,868
AND SO WE WENT TO CLASSES.

946
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:25,901
LATER ON WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT,
I GUESS, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

947
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:27,434
DECIDED THEY WERE LOSING MONEY

948
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:30,734
BY PAYING US TO NOT HAVE
STUDENTS IN OUR CLASSES.

949
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:33,000
THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD USE US
AS SUBSTITUTES,

950
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:34,234
AND THE SUBSTITUTES CAME LATER.

951
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,968
THEY DIDN'T COME
IN THE FIRST OF THE YEAR.

952
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,033
>> SO THE RULE BECAME
THAT IN THE MORNINGS,

953
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:39,567
THEY WOULD WORK
IN THEIR CLASSROOMS

954
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,901
PREPARING MATERIALS,

955
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,701
ENRICHING THEMSELVES
IN SOME WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM

956
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:45,067
TO BE BETTER TEACHERS.

957
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,334
AND IN THE AFTERNOON,
BEGINNING AT NOON,

958
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:49,801
THEY WOULD HAVE CLASSES
THAT THEY TAUGHT EACH OTHER.

959
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,334
BEFORE LONG,
THE SCHOOL BOARD REALIZED

960
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,133
THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT
WAS BEING PAID TO THESE TEACHERS

961
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,934
WAS PRETTY MUCH A LOSS TO THEM,

962
00:42:57,968 --> 00:43:00,400
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MONEY
HAD TO FOLLOW THE STUDENT

963
00:43:00,434 --> 00:43:02,234
TO ANOTHER PUBLIC SCHOOL.

964
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:06,000
SO THEY IMMEDIATELY DECIDED,
ABOUT NOVEMBER,

965
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:08,834
THAT ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS
WOULD NO LONGER

966
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:11,400
HAVE REGULAR SUBSTITUTES
WHO HAD TO BE PAID.

967
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:12,901
BUT TEACHERS
FROM THE HIGH SCHOOLS

968
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:14,934
WOULD GO OUT AND BE SUBSTITUTES.

969
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,167
>> I WAS NOT TOO PLEASED,
REALLY,

970
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
TO TEACH IN THE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL NOR JUNIOR HIGH

971
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:21,601
BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT MY CALLING,
I FELT LIKE IT.

972
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:23,901
BUT I DID A GOOD JOB
WHEN I WENT,

973
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,534
HOPING I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
GO AGAIN.

974
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,467
>> HOW DID THEY FEEL
ABOUT CLOSED SCHOOLS?

975
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,434
THEY WERE VERY FRUSTRATED.

976
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:30,701
THEY SAID THINGS LIKE,

977
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,234
"WE WERE LIKE FISH OUT OF WATER.

978
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:34,300
WE PREPARED AND PREPARED."

979
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:36,767
AND AS THE STUDENTS AND AS
THE PARENTS IN THE COMMUNITY,

980
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:38,234
THEY WERE HOPEFUL.

981
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:41,033
narrator: IN JANUARY, THE NEW
YEAR BROUGHT SOME SMALL CHANGES

982
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:43,701
BY ONE MALE LEADER SPEAKING OUT
FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION.

983
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:46,601
>> THE NEW PRESIDENCY
OF GRAINGER WILLIAMS

984
00:43:46,634 --> 00:43:48,167
AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

985
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,734
AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP,
THEY DO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT

986
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,934
ENCOURAGING THE OPENING
OF THE SCHOOL.

987
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:56,634
narrator: BUT THE GENERAL
ASSEMBLY IS BACK IN SESSION.

988
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,000
AND FAUBUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS
ARE PREPARING

989
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:01,968
TO PASS MORE BILLS
TO BLOCK INTEGRATION.

990
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,267
>> THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT
BY SOME OF FAUBUS' COMPATRIOTS

991
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,834
TO PASS WHAT WAS CALLED
A BOARD PACKING BILL.

992
00:44:09,868 --> 00:44:13,534
THE SCHOOL BOARD IS SPLIT
AFTER DECEMBER

993
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,501
WITH THREE SEGREGATIONISTS
AND THREE MODERATES.

994
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:18,534
AND IF THEY COULD PASS A LAW

995
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:20,200
THAT WOULD ALLOW
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS

996
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:22,133
TO EXIST WITH MORE
THAN SIX PEOPLE,

997
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,968
THEN THEY, PERHAPS, COULD GET
AN APPOINTED MEMBER

998
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,901
OR AN ELECTED
SEGREGATIONIST THERE

999
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:30,767
TO TURN THE TIDE
ON THE BOARD PACKING BILL.

1000
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,901
THIS FAILED.

1001
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:33,868
IN ELIZABETH HUCKABEE'S DIARY,

1002
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:37,200
WHICH WAS SO IMPORTANT
TO MY UNDERSTANDING

1003
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:40,367
OF THE INSIDE STORY
OF THE LOST YEAR,

1004
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,334
SHE DOCUMENTED EVERYTHING,

1005
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,334
AND SHE SAID WHEN
THE BOARD PACKING BILL FAILED,

1006
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:47,501
SHE SAID, "WE ARE SAVED.

1007
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,434
SENATOR FAGAN HAS SAVED US."

1008
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,434
AND SO THIS BILL WAS DEFEATED.

1009
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:55,100
>> MY FATHER WAS
IN SUPPORT OF EDUCATION,

1010
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:58,434
AND HE WAS TRYING, I THINK,

1011
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:01,734
VERY HARD TO AVOID
TAKING A STAND ON INTEGRATION

1012
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:05,000
OR SEGREGATION BUT WANTED
TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN.

1013
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:07,968
HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
THAT THAT POLITICAL BATTLE

1014
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,868
WAS TO BE HELD IN THE CLASSROOM.

1015
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:16,334
SO I DON'T THINK STUDENTS
WERE AS TRAUMATIZED

1016
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:18,000
BY THE FACT
THAT WE WERE GONNA INTEGRATE

1017
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:19,901
OR DID INTEGRATE
THE YEAR BEFORE.

1018
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:24,234
I THINK THE ADULTS WERE THE ONES
THAT WERE RIDDLED WITH FEAR.

1019
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:26,801
WE WERE JUST TEENAGERS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1020
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:28,901
HOW TO FIT IN ALL OF THE CHANGES

1021
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,934
THAT WERE TAKING PLACE
AROUND US.

1022
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:34,100
BUT OUR FAMILY,
BECAUSE OF MY FATHER'S POSITION

1023
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,200
AND THE POWER
THAT HE HELD IN THE SENATE

1024
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,767
AND HAD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,

1025
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:42,400
WE TOOK A BEATING OVER IT.

1026
00:45:42,434 --> 00:45:46,567
PEOPLE REALLY
LASHED OUT PERSONALLY,

1027
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:48,801
MADE PERSONAL ATTACKS
ON OUR FAMILY.

1028
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:52,067
AND EVEN FRIENDS
WERE AFRAID TO BE AROUND US

1029
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,067
OR TO RIDE TO SCHOOL WITH ME
AT THAT TIME AT SYLVAN HILLS

1030
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,701
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T CERTAIN

1031
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:58,701
THAT THE CAR
WOULDN'T BE RUN OFF THE ROAD.

1032
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:02,634
>> WHAT THE LOST YEAR DOES IS,
IT SPLITS THE WHITE COMMUNITY.

1033
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,834
IT SPLITS IT,
AND IT MAKES THAT DIVISION

1034
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:12,901
IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY DEEPER
AND WIDER AND MORE COMBATIVE.

1035
00:46:12,934 --> 00:46:15,334
narrator: IN MAY OF 1959,
AN EVENT HAPPENED

1036
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:17,534
THAT WOULD CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE
IN LITTLE ROCK.

1037
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,334
THE SCHOOL BOARD
WENT INTO SESSION

1038
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:22,033
TO REVIEW TEACHER'S CONTRACTS
FOR THE COMING YEAR.

1039
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:24,434
WITHOUT A QUORUM,
THE SEGREGATIONISTS

1040
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:28,000
PROCEEDED TO FIRE 44 TEACHERS
AND ADMINISTRATORS.

1041
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:30,701
>> THE IDEA OF A PURGE
HAS BEEN CIRCULATING,

1042
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,567
AND EVERYONE'S FEELING
A LITTLE UNEASY ABOUT THIS.

1043
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:36,234
EVERY ISSUE
THAT CAME BEFORE THE BOARD

1044
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:38,267
AS HAD BEEN IN RECENT MONTHS,

1045
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,200
ENDED WITH A THREE-THREE VOTE.

1046
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:42,367
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY SPLIT.

1047
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,601
SO WHEN THEY BROKE FOR LUNCH,

1048
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,501
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS
BY LEGAL COUNSEL,

1049
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,901
THE MODERATE MEMBERS
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD

1050
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:54,601
DECIDED TO LEAVE, SIMPLY
TO NOT COME BACK AFTER LUNCH.

1051
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:58,400
AND THEY THOUGHT BY DOING THIS
THERE WOULD BE NO QUORUM

1052
00:46:58,434 --> 00:47:00,467
IN THE SIX MEMBER BOARD.

1053
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:03,000
AND THEREFORE,
THEY COULD NOT DO THEIR INTENT

1054
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:04,834
OF TRYING TO PURGE TEACHERS.

1055
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:07,868
THEY FIRE 44 TEACHERS
AND ADMINISTRATORS.

1056
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:10,501
MOST ARE WHITE;
A FEW ARE BLACK.

1057
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:12,767
MOST OF THEM
WERE FROM CENTRAL HIGH,

1058
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:14,133
BUT NOT ALL WERE.

1059
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:18,033
SOME WERE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPALS,

1060
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,267
EVEN TWO SECRETARIES.

1061
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,100
>> I WAS IN THE CARPOOL.

1062
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:27,334
I THINK WE HAD THE RADIO ON,
AND WITH THREE OTHER TEACHERS,

1063
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,400
AND WE HEARD THAT THREE PEOPLE
HAD MET AND FIRED US.

1064
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,901
AND THEN WE RECEIVED A LETTER.

1065
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:34,267
>> "THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU
THAT YOUR CONTRACT

1066
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,901
"WITH THE LITTLE ROCK
SCHOOL DISTRICT

1067
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:38,601
HAS NOT
AND WILL NOT BE RENEWED."

1068
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:42,000
>> I COULD THINK OF TWO REASONS
THAT I WOULD BE.

1069
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:45,767
ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN MY INTERVIEW
WITH THE STATE POLICE,

1070
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:51,501
AND THEN THE OTHER WAS THAT
I WOULD NOT SIGN MY CONTRACT,

1071
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,767
A CONTRACT
WITH A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

1072
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:56,000
>> MOST OF THEM
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE LABELED

1073
00:47:56,033 --> 00:47:59,801
AS THE COOPERATIONISTS,

1074
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:02,968
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
COOPERATED WITH OR ENDORSED

1075
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,601
OR WERE SYMPATHETIC
TO THE LITTLE ROCK NINE

1076
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,234
AND TO THE INTEGRATION
OF THE SCHOOLS.

1077
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:10,968
narrator:
THE PURGE OF THE TEACHERS

1078
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,300
BY THE SEGREGATIONISTS

1079
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:15,667
GAVE THE MODERATES A WAY
TO RALLY ALL THEIR SUPPORTERS.

1080
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:17,701
>> HOW CAN WE GET SCHOOLS OPEN

1081
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:20,367
WITHOUT SAYING WE'RE ABSOLUTELY
FOR INTEGRATION?

1082
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,601
>> BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS
TRYING TO MAKE THIS

1083
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:25,667
NOT AN INTEGRATION-SEGREGATION
DECISION

1084
00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:27,601
BUT INSTEAD A REOPENING
OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

1085
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:31,868
>> IF YOU PURGE OUR REVERED
AND RESPECTED TEACHERS,

1086
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:34,767
YOU HAVE OVERSTEPPED.

1087
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:37,100
YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY
THEIR DUE PROCESS.

1088
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:39,868
YOU'VE COMPLETELY
BROKEN THE LAW.

1089
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:43,033
AND SO THIS GIVES THEM
A RALLYING CRY.

1090
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:45,701
SO WITHIN DAYS AFTER THE PURGE,

1091
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:47,601
THE WOMEN'S EMERGENCY COMMITTEE,
OF COURSE,

1092
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,267
CONVENES IMMEDIATELY.

1093
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,834
THEY MAKE
THE FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENT

1094
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:53,067
ENDORSING THE TEACHERS
WHO'VE BEEN PURGED.

1095
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,934
narrator: FINALLY,
AS THE COMMUNITY ATTITUDE

1096
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:56,234
IS BEGINNING TO SHIFT,

1097
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,033
THE STOP COMMITTEE IS FORMED.

1098
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:00,501
BOTH ADULTS AND LOST YEAR TEENS

1099
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:03,000
PICKED UP THE BANNER
OF THE STOP CAMPAIGN.

1100
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:06,100
AND THE TIDE BEGAN TO TURN
IN LITTLE ROCK.

1101
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:10,734
>> STOP STOOD FOR
STOP THIS OUTRAGEOUS PURGE.

1102
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:14,701
AND IT BECAME SOMETHING OTHER
THAN THE W.E.C.

1103
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:18,267
IT BECAME A FOCUS
ON THE FIRING OF THE TEACHERS,

1104
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,267
AND THEY BEGAN
A 20-DAY CAMPAIGN.

1105
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,701
WHAT COULD THEY DO?

1106
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:25,367
THEY COULD USE THE NEW LAW

1107
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,801
THAT ALLOWED FOR THE RECALL
OF A BOARD MEMBER.

1108
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:30,567
THEY CAN USE IT
AGAINST THE SEGREGATIONISTS.

1109
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,334
SO THEY HAVE
TO GET THE PETITIONS.

1110
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:35,434
THEY HAVE
TO GET THE PETITIONS SIGNED.

1111
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:39,167
THEY SET UP PLACES TO SIGN
AT WAR MEMORIAL STADIUM,

1112
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,234
HAD PEOPLE DRIVE DOWN THERE
AND SIGN THE PETITION.

1113
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:44,167
THEY PUSHED THEIR ADVERTISING.

1114
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,701
THEY WENT DOOR TO DOOR.

1115
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:47,667
THEY HAD BEEN ORGANIZED
FOR A YEAR,

1116
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,734
KNOWING THE VOTERS
IN EACH PRECINCT.

1117
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,067
THEY KICKED INTO ACTION.

1118
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,200
OFTENTIMES STOP
GETS THE CREDIT FOR THIS,

1119
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:54,934
BUT THE WOMEN'S
EMERGENCY COMMITTEE

1120
00:49:54,968 --> 00:49:56,567
WERE DOING THE WORK
BEHIND THE SCENES.

1121
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:59,968
>> I THINK IRVING SPITZBERG
AND I WERE CO-CHAIRMEN

1122
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,067
OF THE JUNIOR STOP COMMITTEE,

1123
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,767
WHICH TRIED TO ORGANIZE
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

1124
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:08,801
TO HELP WITH THE STOP CAMPAIGN.

1125
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:11,267
narrator: OF COURSE,
THERE WAS OPPOSITION TO THIS,

1126
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,667
AND THE SEGREGATIONISTS
FORMED CROSS:

1127
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:17,067
COMMITTEE TO RETAIN
OUR SEGREGATED SCHOOLS.

1128
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,133
>> THE MOTHERS' LEAGUE
OF CENTRAL HIGH,

1129
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,834
THE CAPITAL CITIZENS' COUNCIL,

1130
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:25,501
THE SEGREGATIONISTS
RALLIED TO THE CROSS CAMPAIGN.

1131
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:30,000
THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE
ON MAY 25TH

1132
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:33,734
WAS A NARROW--
A VERY NARROW VICTORY

1133
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:34,934
FOR THE MODERATES,

1134
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,567
BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL
IN RECALLING

1135
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,434
THE MORE SEGREGATIONIST SCHOOL
BOARD MEMBERS.

1136
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:44,467
>> THE BLACK COMMUNITY
AND THE SILK STOCKING DISTRICTS

1137
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,100
WON THE ELECTION.

1138
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:49,501
AND IT WAS DONE
BECAUSE OF THE SOPHISTICATION

1139
00:50:49,534 --> 00:50:51,000
OF THE WOMEN'S
EMERGENCY COMMITTEE

1140
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:54,400
AND HENRY WOODS AND THE ABILITY
TO DO THIS TARGETING.

1141
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:56,467
AND THE FACT
THAT WE COULD DO THE--

1142
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:58,467
HAD ALL THESE PILES OF CARDS,

1143
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:02,367
AND IT WAS
A SOPHISTICATED CAMPAIGN,

1144
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,701
AND WE TURNED OUT THE VOTE.

1145
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:06,133
ONE OF THE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND

1146
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,167
ABOUT WHAT WAS
A NECESSARY CONDITION

1147
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,400
FOR HAVING
THE REOPENING OF THE SCHOOLS

1148
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,634
THROUGH THE STOP CAMPAIGN

1149
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,100
WAS THE FACT
THAT ALL OF THE FAMILIES

1150
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,901
OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED

1151
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:18,734
HAD BEEN PART
OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

1152
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:20,000
AND IN LITTLE ROCK,

1153
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:23,067
IN BOTH THE BLACK COMMUNITY
AND THE WHITE COMMUNITY,

1154
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:28,033
THERE WAS A SENSE OF GREAT PRIDE
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

1155
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:32,467
AND TODAY IN MOST OF THE MAJOR
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES,

1156
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:35,801
ONE WOULD NOT HAVE
THE SAME SORT OF RESPONSE

1157
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:38,200
FROM THE BURGER ELITE

1158
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:40,400
TO ANY ATTACK
ON THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

1159
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,901
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY
AREN'T ENROLLED IN IT.

1160
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,901
AND THIS IS
ONE OF THE GREAT WORRIES

1161
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:49,367
ABOUT HOW COMMUNITIES
IN THE UNITED STATES--

1162
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,734
AND THIS IS NOT
JUST LITTLE ROCK--

1163
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:52,067
COMMUNITIES
IN THE UNITED STATES

1164
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,300
WILL RESPOND TO CRISES
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

1165
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:58,200
IF ALL OF THE PARTS
OF THE COMMUNITY

1166
00:51:58,234 --> 00:52:03,133
AREN'T ENROLLED IN
THE MAJOR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

1167
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,400
OF THE LARGER SOCIETY.

1168
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:06,734
AND SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE

1169
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,133
WHAT YOU HAVE
IN LITTLE ROCK TODAY,

1170
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,033
ALL THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS,

1171
00:52:10,067 --> 00:52:13,901
WHERE MOST OF THE UPPER
MIDDLE CLASS SEND THEIR KIDS,

1172
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:16,834
YOU LOSE WHAT I CALL
THE MORAL CRUNCH

1173
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:21,133
OF THE EXPERIENCE
OF MAKING DECISIONS

1174
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,734
ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY.

1175
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:26,467
BECAUSE IF YOUR PERSONAL
INTERESTS AREN'T AT STAKE,

1176
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:30,100
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU YOURSELF

1177
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:32,834
OR YOUR FAMILY
BEING AFFECTED BY DECISIONS,

1178
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:36,167
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET ETHICAL DECISIONS.

1179
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,767
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET RATIONAL DECISIONS.

1180
00:52:38,801 --> 00:52:40,334
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE--

1181
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:43,467
IF THE DECISIONS
AREN'T REALLY GONNA IMPACT YOU,

1182
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:45,434
YOUR ATTENTION
TO WHAT'S INVOLVED

1183
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:48,267
IS SEVERELY COMPROMISED.

1184
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,234
AND SO IF ONE HAD
THE LITTLE ROCK CRISIS TODAY,

1185
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:55,334
IF ONE HAD THE GOVERNOR
SAY THAT HE WAS

1186
00:52:55,367 --> 00:52:58,167
GOING TO SHUT DOWN
THE LITTLE ROCK PUBLIC SCHOOLS,

1187
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,868
I'M AFRAID THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
WOULD RESPOND THIS WAY.

1188
00:53:01,901 --> 00:53:03,100
[yawns]

1189
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,167
"OH, WHAT A SHAME."

1190
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,667
AND THAT WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE SHAME INDEED.

1191
00:53:09,701 --> 00:53:11,567
narrator: ALTHOUGH MANY FAMILIES
IN LITTLE ROCK

1192
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:14,300
DIDN'T THINK THE SCHOOLS WOULD
REOPEN THAT FOLLOWING YEAR

1193
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:17,033
AND MADE PLANS FOR THEIR TEENS
TO GO ELSEWHERE--

1194
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:19,701
>> WE HAD THESE JUNIORS WHO,

1195
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:23,234
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THIS
STARTED THIS YEAR,

1196
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:25,434
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE IT
STARTED NEXT YEAR.

1197
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:28,567
SO THERE'S NO POINT
IN US HANGING AROUND

1198
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:32,601
WAITING TO SEE
WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO.

1199
00:53:32,634 --> 00:53:36,734
narrator: THE FOUR HIGH SCHOOLS
DID REOPEN IN AUGUST OF 1959

1200
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:38,667
BUT NOT WITHOUT CONFLICT.

1201
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:41,133
THREE BOMBS
WERE EXPLODED IN THE CITY

1202
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:43,367
AT THE OPENING
OF THAT SCHOOL YEAR.

1203
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,067
>> THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,

1204
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,734
THERE WAS A RALLY
OUTSIDE THE STATE CAPITOL,

1205
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:51,767
AND THE MARCHERS MARCHED
WITH SIGNS

1206
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:55,434
AND CONFEDERATE FLAGS IN CARS
TO CENTRAL HIGH.

1207
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:58,467
IT'S NOT THAT FAR FROM
THE CAPITOL TO CENTRAL HIGH.

1208
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,434
BUT THEY WERE STOPPED
TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL

1209
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:04,467
BY THE LITTLE ROCK POLICE

1210
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:06,934
AND BY WATER HOSES
OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

1211
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:08,300
narrator: WITH THE OPENING

1212
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:11,601
OF THE FOUR LITTLE ROCK
HIGH SCHOOLS IN AUGUST OF 1959,

1213
00:54:11,634 --> 00:54:13,234
WITH HALL AND CENTRAL
BOTH HAVING

1214
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:15,067
AFRICAN-AMERICAN
STUDENTS ENROLLED,

1215
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,200
THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE
MOVED ON

1216
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:19,767
TO OTHER CITIES
AND TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA.

1217
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,234
>> AT THE TIME THAT LITTLE
ROCK'S SCHOOLS

1218
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,300
WERE STILL CLOSED
IN THAT SPRING,

1219
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:26,067
VIRGINIA SCHOOLS HAD OPENED--

1220
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,634
THE CLOSED SCHOOLS IN VIRGINIA
HAD OPENED.

1221
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:33,868
AND THE NEXT BATTLES
IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

1222
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:35,868
IN SCHOOLS
WILL MOVE TO OTHER STATES.

1223
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,901
AT LEAST THE FOCUS
WILL MOVE AWAY FROM ARKANSAS,

1224
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:44,367
AND THEY WILL GO ON TO OTHER
CONFRONTATIONS IN OTHER STATES.

1225
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,901
narrator: AND NOW,
50 YEARS LATER,

1226
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,834
THE PEOPLE OF LITTLE ROCK
LOOK BACK

1227
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,100
ON THOSE TUMULTUOUS TIMES
WITH SADNESS.

1228
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:52,901
>> THE CRISIS MADE ME
SO MUCH MORE MINDFUL

1229
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:56,834
OF OTHER PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS.

1230
00:54:56,868 --> 00:54:59,000
>> THE CRISIS YEAR
IS A PUBLIC YEAR.

1231
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:02,734
THERE ARE CHARACTERS--
IT'S LIKE A DRAMA

1232
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:06,534
THERE ARE CHARACTERS
ON EITHER END OF THE SPECTRUM,

1233
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:11,801
AND THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLICITY
GIVEN SHOWED EXTREMIST VIEWS.

1234
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:15,133
AND IT WAS PLAYED OUT
ON A VERY PUBLIC STAGE,

1235
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:18,534
BUT THE LOST YEAR
IS PLAYED OUT QUIETLY.

1236
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:21,234
IT HAS PLAYED OUT
OVER LIFETIMES

1237
00:55:21,267 --> 00:55:26,167
IN THE PRIVATE LIVES
OF ALMOST 4,000 STUDENTS

1238
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,567
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

1239
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:30,834
AND IT HAS PLAYED OUT INTO
THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE,

1240
00:55:30,868 --> 00:55:33,000
INTO THE ATTITUDES
THAT THEY HAVE.

1241
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:34,901
THERE ARE STILL RACISTS LEFT.

1242
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:38,300
THERE ARE RACIST PEOPLE
IN ARKANSAS AND ELSEWHERE

1243
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,200
WHO HAD THIS EXPERIENCE.

1244
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:45,901
BUT FAITH IN FELLOW MAN
TELLS ME THAT THE PEOPLE

1245
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:48,467
WHO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS
AND RIGHT DECISIONS

1246
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:51,801
CAN LEARN FROM IT
AND CAN GROW FROM THAT

1247
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:56,234
AND CAN SHAPE THEIR CHILDREN
IN THAT WAY.

1248
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:58,167
narrator: AFTER LEARNING
OF THE LOST YEAR,

1249
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,601
PERHAPS THEY WILL HAVE
JUST A BIT OF PRIDE

1250
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:02,567
FOR THE BRAVE PEOPLE
WHO STOOD UP

1251
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:04,400
TO TURN THEIR COMMUNITY AROUND.

1252
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:07,067
>> WHEN YOU GO TO THE HEART
AND SOUL OF THE COMMUNITY,

1253
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,400
YOU GO TO ITS SCHOOLS.

1254
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:11,601
AND WHEN THE SEGREGATIONISTS

1255
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,934
TOOK THEIR STAND
AT THE SCHOOL DOOR,

1256
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:18,801
I STILL WORRY
THAT THEY USED THE CHILDREN

1257
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,434
TO MAKE THAT STAND.

1258
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:23,434
>> WE ALL FELT
LIKE WE'D BEEN USED

1259
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,968
AND THAT OUR SACRIFICE
IN THE NAME

1260
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,968
OF INTEGRATION OR SEGREGATION,
WHICHEVER WAY,

1261
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,133
HAS NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED.

1262
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:38,901
>> I WOULD LOOK TO 1957, '58
AS ONE OF OUR SADDEST MOMENTS,

1263
00:56:38,934 --> 00:56:47,501
BUT I WOULD LOOK TO MAY OF 1959
AS AN EPIPHANY FOR A FEW PEOPLE,

1264
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:50,334
FOR A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
WHO WOULD GO TO THE POLLS

1265
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,100
AND TAKE THE EFFORT TO VOTE.

1266
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:57,334
I THINK THAT WAS
OUR SHINING MOMENT, ACTUALLY.

1267
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,400
AND MOST PEOPLE
DON'T EVEN KNOW IT HAPPENED.

1268
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:05,033
THE LOST YEAR IS SO IMPORTANT
TO LITTLE ROCK

1269
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:10,667
BECAUSE THE YEAR BEFORE,
WE WERE BRANDED A CITY OF HATE.

1270
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:16,300
BUT THE ELECTION OF MAY 25TH
SHOWED THAT LITTLE ROCK

1271
00:57:16,334 --> 00:57:19,801
COULD BE MOTIVATED
INTRINSICALLY.

1272
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:22,901
THEY WERE NOT MOTIVATED
BY AN OUTSIDE COURT ORDER.

1273
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:26,434
THEY WERE MOTIVATED FROM WITHIN

1274
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:30,234
THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION
NEEDED TO GO FORWARD

1275
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,801
AND THAT DESEGREGATION
COULD MOVE FORWARD

1276
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,901
IN A GRADUAL
AND ACCEPTABLE FORM.

1277
00:57:36,934 --> 00:57:39,033
IT MAY HAVE BEEN
A STILL SMALL VOICE,

1278
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:41,868
BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
LITTLE ROCK FOUND ITS VOICE

1279
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:45,868
AND TURNED ITSELF AROUND.

1280
00:57:45,901 --> 00:57:47,801
narrator: LIVES
WERE CHANGED FOREVER,

1281
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:49,367
AND THE STORY OF THE LOST YEAR

1282
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,467
WILL PERHAPS
BE REMEMBERED SOMEDAY

1283
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,100
AS A BRIGHT SPOT
IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE,

1284
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:57,934
A STRUGGLE
THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY.

1285
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:06,267
>> MY AUNT AND UNCLE
LEGALLY ADOPTED ME

1286
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,234
SO I WAS ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL
AT HOUSTON, TEXAS.

1287
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:12,934
>> I WENT TO J.C. COOK
IN WRIGHTSVILLE, ARKANSAS,

1288
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:15,534
THE SECOND SEMESTER
THAT SCHOOL YEAR.

1289
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:16,901
>> SYLVAN HILLS.

1290
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:19,434
THERE WAS ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT
OF US GOT IN A CAR ONE DAY

1291
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:21,133
AND DROVE AROUND
UNTIL WE FOUND SOME SCHOOL

1292
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,367
THAT WOULD LET US COME IN.

1293
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,701
>> I WENT TO SCHOOL
ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS

1294
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,601
AND SHOT SNOOKER
AT THE POOL HALL IN CABOT,

1295
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:28,033
MONDAYS, WEDNESDAYS,
AND FRIDAYS,

1296
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:29,334
AND STILL PASSED.

1297
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:31,834
>> I WENT TO SYLVAN HILLS
IN NORTH LITTLE ROCK.

1298
00:58:31,868 --> 00:58:35,334
>> I ATTENDED A HIGH SCHOOL
IN MISSOURI.

1299
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:37,601
I LIVED WITH MY GRANDPARENTS
FOR ONE SEMESTER.

1300
00:58:37,634 --> 00:58:40,767
THEN I CAME BACK TO LITTLE ROCK
AND WENT ON TO COLLEGE.

1301
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:42,968
>> THE LOST YEAR, I WENT
TO T.J. RANEY HIGH SCHOOL

1302
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,501
WHICH WAS DOWN
AT 14TH AND CEDAR.

1303
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:46,467
>> THE YEAR
THAT OUR SCHOOLS CLOSED,

1304
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:49,367
I WENT TO KIRKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL
IN KIRKWOOD, MISSOURI.

1305
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,934
>> IN 1958, '59,
I WAS LOCKED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,

1306
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:55,868
AND I WENT TO SCHOOL
AT J.C. COOK

1307
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:57,234
IN WRIGHTSVILLE, ARKANSAS.

1308
00:58:57,267 --> 00:59:00,133
>> AND I SPENT
MY SENIOR YEAR TUTORING

1309
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,467
THE FOOTBALL TEAM
IN THE MORNINGS

1310
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,400
AND BEING TUTORED MYSELF
IN THE AFTERNOONS.

1311
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:07,801
>> MOST OF IT
AT JACKSONVILLE HIGH SCHOOL,

1312
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:09,834
17 MILES NORTH OF LITTLE ROCK.

1313
00:59:09,868 --> 00:59:12,434
I DROVE UP
IN MY LITTLE BROWN FORD.

1314
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:15,100
>> I HAD NO FAMILY IN
ANY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY,

1315
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:17,634
SO I HAD NO PLACE TO CALL HOME,

1316
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:21,100
SO I WENT TO WORK
AND TOOK COURSES AT NIGHT.

1317
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:23,934
>> I WENT TO SCHOOL
AT SOUTHEAST HIGH SCHOOL

1318
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:25,100
IN PINE BLUFF, ARKANSAS.

1319
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:28,167
>> WE LEFT AND WENT TO MEMPHIS
TO SCHOOL

1320
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,601
FOR ONE SEMESTER,

1321
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:31,400
TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL THERE.

1322
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,567
>> UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T
GET INTO A SCHOOL THAT YEAR.

1323
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,801
MY MOTHER WOULD PLAY THE RADIO
EVERY DAY,

1324
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,601
HOPING THE SCHOOLS WOULD OPEN.

1325
00:59:38,634 --> 00:59:42,567
BUT THEY DIDN'T, SO SHE TOOK US
TO THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL,

1326
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:45,801
BUT THE SISTER TOLD US THAT
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE ROOM.

1327
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,868
>> I WAS A CHEERLEADER
AT THAT TIME.

1328
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:50,300
AND THEY HAD TOLD US
THAT IF THE SCHOOLS WERE--

1329
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:52,767
THEY WEREN'T OPEN YET,
BUT IF WE WENT AWAY,

1330
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,100
THEN WE COULD NOT CHEER.

1331
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,200
>> THERE WERE MANY KIDS

1332
00:59:55,234 --> 00:59:58,968
WHO NEVER RETURNED
TO HORACE MANN HIGH.

1333
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,734
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
CENTRAL OR HALL.
