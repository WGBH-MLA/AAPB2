## Introduction

On his first publicity tour promoting his anti-poverty legislation, Lyndon Johnson went to the economically depressed region of Appalachia.  The region was the historical heart of coal mining country, but between 1950 and 1960, the number of Pennsylvania miners dropped by two-thirds due to automation and modernization.  Unemployment soared, consumer spending at local businesses plummeted, and tax revenue dwindled. The economic base had collapsed, and workers struggled to find new jobs, making the region an ideal target for the War on Poverty. This clip from a 1964 episode of Local Issue produced by WQED in Pittsburgh and called Appalachia: Survival of a Region,‚Äù explores initiatives underway in Appalachia aimed at redeveloping the economy, restoring the environment, and fighting poverty.
