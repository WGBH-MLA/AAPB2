## Introduction

As mentioned in the introduction to this discussion set, Community Action Programs (CAPs) represented a particularly controversial aspect of the War on Poverty. CAPs were federally funded but locally administered, meaning that local governments and community members had the responsibility of designing and implementing these programs. This excerpt from an episode of National Educational Televisionâ€™s _Regional Report_ entitled _Skirmish with Poverty_, shows the logistical and political challenges that could arise when getting these programs off the ground.  Focusing on the case of Trinidad, Colorado, the clip shows how ineffective coordination between state and local governments, as well as squabbles between local political leaders, made it difficult to turn federal money into operational anti-poverty programs.
