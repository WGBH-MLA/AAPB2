## Introduction

This clip from The Cities and The Poor, Part 1, an episode of the America’s Crises series produced by National Education Television, begins by surveying the social problems in Black urban ghettos. In line with the arguments made in the controversial 1965 Department of Labor Moynihan Report, “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,” the excerpt emphasizes the phenomenon of children growing up in fatherless homes, rooting that problem in the bleak economic prospects for Black men. It then continues to survey several anti-poverty initiatives in Chicago, including a job placement program and a Head Start center, that are aimed at breaking what the narrator calls “the cycle of inherited deprivation.”
