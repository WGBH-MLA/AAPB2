## Introduction

In 1962, professor and activist Michael Harrington wrote an influential book that challenged the prevailing narrative about widespread abundance and opportunity in postwar America. Instead, in his book The Other America, Harrington focused on the tens of millions of Americans who remained stuck living miserable lives and, worse yet, were invisible to the rest of the country.  In this excerpt from a year-end episode of the National Education Television series Perspectives aired in late 1962, Michael Harrington urgently describes the persistence of poverty and delivers a call for action directly into the camera.
