## Introduction

Bayard Rustin is an unsung hero of the Black Freedom Struggle, a behind-the-scenes organizer who planned the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  In a speech entitled “Firebombs or a Freedom Budget” that aired on WGBH radio in 1967, he criticizes the inadequacy of War on Poverty job training programs in addressing the problem of “hopelessness” that was leading to “riots” in Black communities. Instead, he argues for a “Freedom Budget for All Americans,” a ten-year plan developed in 1966 by the A. Philip Randolph Institute in conjunction with a coalition of civil rights, labor, and religious leaders, and other public intellectuals.  The “Freedom Budget” called for the government to provide jobs, free education, and free healthcare to the poor–a program of expansive state action that would have dwarfed the War on Poverty. However, this excerpt also shows how Rustin criticizes Black “militants” who are fighting at the local level for community participation.
