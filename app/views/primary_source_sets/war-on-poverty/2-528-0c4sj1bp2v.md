## Introduction

Just six weeks after assuming office upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson delivered his first State of the Union address. He wasted no time laying out an ambitious legislative agenda, which he framed in the speech as an effort to “carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy—not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.”  In this excerpt, Johnson makes his famous declaration of an “unconditional war on poverty” and lays out his broad vision for how the government would fight that war.
