## Introduction

The War on Poverty generally sought to help lift up low-income Americans, but one group was both disproportionately poor and struggling with a distinct set of challenges: Black Americans. In this broadcast of the Howard University Commencement on WHUT in Washington, DC, Lyndon Johnson makes the case that Black Americans deserved more than just equal rights—that “freedom is not enough.” He explains that Black people have been “hobbled by chains” for generations, and merely granting theoretical “equality…as a theory” would not lead to “equality of result.”  This logic provided the rationale for the War on Poverty as a means of pursuing racial justice; anti-poverty programs could help ensure that the “gates of opportunity” were not only open, but that Black Americans had the “ability to walk through those gates.”
