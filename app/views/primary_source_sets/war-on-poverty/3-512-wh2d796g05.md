## Introduction

This roundtable discussion pits left-wing and right-wing economists against one another to debate whether and how the government ought to intervene in the economy to combat poverty.  The first speaker is Herbert Striner, an economist who was head of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and an economic adviser on employment and training for the Johnson Administration.  His arguments for enhanced government action are met with opposition from influential University of Chicago economist and champion of free-market capitalism, Milton Friedman.
