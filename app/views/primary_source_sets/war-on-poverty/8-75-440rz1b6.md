## Introduction

In mid-1960s Mississippi, the struggles for community control of Community Action Programs (CAPs) were grafted atop a bubbling political battle between the grassroots Black Freedom Struggle and the white segregationist political elite. One focus was the Head Start program, which provided preschool education to low-income residents—in Mississippi, virtually all participants were Black. The program was administered by the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CDGM), which was staffed and led by Black community members, many of whom were active in civil rights activism. Many white Mississippians viewed CDGM and the Head Start program as a front for subversive activity, and multiple Head Start centers were burned down. Local white political leaders eventually pressured the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO, the federal agency that oversaw War on Poverty programs) to defund CDGM and put the Head Start program in the hands of a white-majority board (with a few moderate African Americans). In this clip from a 1966 _NET Journal_ episode called _Head Start in Mississippi_, black activists and community members rally to save CDGM’s funding and restore its control of Head Start. It includes an electrifying speech by legendary grassroots leader Fannie Lou Hamer, and generally shows how battles for community control of War on Poverty programs intersected with the fight for Black freedom.
