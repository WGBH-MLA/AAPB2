## Introduction

The struggle for control of anti-poverty programs took on a racial dimension in the Black communities of the North and West. The second part of _The Cities and The Poor_ from NET’s  America’s Crises series focused on the bitter conflict that emerged in Los Angeles over the direction of the Neighborhood Adult Participation Project (NAPP), a federally-funded Community Action Agency that sought to provide employment and training to impoverished Los Angeles residents. NAPP’s Black leader, Opal Jones, was fired by the Executive Director of the larger Los Angeles welfare agency, Joe Maldonado, leading to a staff revolt. Protestors charged that Jones’ firing was part of a broader effort of the “power structure” to take influence away from poor, Black communities. This clip documents a protest that took place in 1966, in the shadow of the 1965 Watts Riots, and features activists wearing Malcolm X garb. Thus, War on Poverty programs provided one venue in which Black activists shifted their emphasis from the goal of integration and legal equality towards “Black Power.”
