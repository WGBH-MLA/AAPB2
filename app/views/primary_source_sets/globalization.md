## Introduction

In the decades after World War II, the economies of the world became increasingly interconnected, and more and more economic activity crossed international boundaries. Between 1950 and 2022, the total inflation-adjusted value of global trade [increased by 4500%](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/trade_evolution_e/evolution_trade_wto_e.htm). In 1950, the value of imports to the United States represented 3.9% of the country’s gross domestic product (a measure of a country’s overall economic production). By 2022, that [proportion had quadrupled to 15.4%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B021RE1A156NBEA). US Exports also increased significantly during this time period. 

These developments were driven, in significant part, by technological change. Improved communication (via satellites, and eventually the internet) made it easy to conduct business and orchestrate complex logistical endeavors over long distances. Advances in maritime technology and the transformative adoption of the rectangular shipping container allowed for cheaper, quicker ocean transportation of massive amounts of goods. But globalization was also a product of policy. In the postwar period, the U.S. led a charge towards “free trade,” a political approach in which governments lowered or removed various barriers to international commerce (such as tariffs and import quotas). Advocates believed that by opening trade between nations, a country could gain a market for their exports while benefiting from the importation of desirable goods from other countries.

Many Americans, including most leading politicians, celebrated global trade as a key component of American prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s. But by the 1970s, the growth of imports into the U.S. led to social and political challenges. Companies in industrialized countries like Japan and Germany increasingly outcompeted American businesses in the automobile, steel, and home electronics industries. Later in the 20th century, the import challenge came from developing countries with lower labor costs.  Firms in these countries produced manufactured goods such as toys and clothing at lower prices than American companies. While consumers benefited from the opportunity to buy cheaper or more desirable goods from other countries, certain American industries suffered, leading to job layoffs and economic hardship. In particular, communities that relied heavily on industrial jobs struggled when local companies lost to foreign companies (or when those local companies moved operations out of the country to take advantage of lower labor costs).

These economic changes led to political disagreements about the merits of global trade and the desirability of “free trade” policies. Critics pointed to lost jobs, stagnating working-class wages, and crumbling communities. Defenders argued that global trade optimized overall economic growth, provided export opportunities for American firms, and benefited consumers by giving them the opportunity to buy cheaper goods. Resulting political debates forced Americans to grapple with difficult questions: in the balance, did the benefits of global trade outweigh the costs? Should the U.S. government establish trade restrictions on imported goods to protect American businesses and workers? To the extent some Americans were harmed by global competition, what responsibilities did the government have to those communities? Disagreements over these questions led to fierce fights over trade policy and divided (and ultimately reshaped) political coalitions.

## Teachingtips

These clips are divided into three “modules”: (1) The first four clips trace a historical narrative documenting important stages of the rise of globalization in the second half of the twentieth century; (2) The next four clips provide differing perspectives on the costs and benefits of global trade and “free trade” arrangements; (3) The last four clips are related to the rise of Donald Trump, and how trade policy and critiques of globalization informed his 2016 campaign and presidency. There is an associated classroom activity for each module, as well as a “debate” activity that would work well with the set as a whole. 

#### Background Information

Before engaging with this resource set, students should be familiar with the following:
- The rise and maturation of an industrialized economy in the U.S. by the mid-20th Century
- General background about policies that can either promote or restrict international trade (e.g. tariffs, quotas)

<hr>

#### Essential Question 

In the balance, has the increase in global trade since World War II harmed or benefited Americans?

<hr>

#### General Discussion Questions

- What arguments would a defender of “free trade” make about the benefits of globalization?
- What arguments would a critic of “free trade” make about the costs of globalization?
- What policies should the U.S. government pursue with respect to trade with companies in other countries? For example, should the U.S. place tariffs on imported goods?
- When considering the impact of global trade on people in the United States, economists commonly argue that global trade provides an overall economic benefit to American society as a whole, but a subset of Americans will be worse off as a result. What should the government do if a given policy would provide a net benefit to society but would harm a specific sub-group in that society?

<hr>

#### Classroom Activities

1) Watch the following clips:
- [Postwar Optimism about the Economic Benefits of International Trade](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/1-postwar-optimism)
- [The Growing “Threat” of Imported Goods in the 1970s](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/2-growing-threat)
- [NAFTA Promotes US Trade with Mexico and Canada](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/3-NAFTA-trade)
- [Ocean Trade and the Explosion of Global Commerce](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/4-ocean-trade)

Show students [the following chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B021RE1A156NBEA) showing the rise of imports starting in the 1970s. Discuss the following questions:

- What kinds of goods became increasingly likely to be imported into the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries?
- What are some reasons that certain imported goods might be more desirable to American consumers?
- What social, economic, or political factors help explain the rise in international trade over this timeframe?

2) Ask students to watch:
- [Walmart, Sweatshops, and the Price of Cheap Clothes](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/5-walmart-sweatshops)
- [Organized Labor’s Critique of Globalization and Free Trade](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/6-organized-labors)
- [Defending Free Trade Against its Critics](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/7-free-trade)
- [The Complex Impact of Globalization on Alabama Communities](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/8-globalization-impact)

These sources collectively illuminate some of the complex “pros and cons” of global trade. Then have students discuss the following questions:

- What are some ways that people benefit from global trade?
- What are some ways that people are harmed by global trade?
- What are some examples of specific people or groups that might benefit from global trade? Specific people and groups that are harmed?
- What do you think? In the balance, are Americans better or worse off as a result of global trade? What actions do you think the government should (or shouldn’t) take to restrain or restrict international commerce?

3) During his ultimately successful 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump railed against the impact that “free trade” deals and the rise of China had had on American businesses and workers. In this regard, Trump was far more critical of globalization and “free trade” than most Republican political leaders in recent U.S. History. Ask students to watch:
- [The Lessons of the “Elephant Chart”](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/9-elephant-chart)
- [Debating Global Trade in the Age of Trump](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/10-debating-global-trade)
- [Trump’s Trade Policy and Criticism of China](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/11-trump-trade-policy)
- [The Biden Administration’s Combative Stance with China](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/globalization/12-biden-china)

These sources revolve around the views and policies around trade of Donald Trump and his Democratic successor Joe Biden. Then discuss the following questions:

- Donald Trump performed meaningfully better than other recent Republican candidates among certain demographic groups: including white voters without college degrees, labor union members, and residents of certain “Rust Belt” counties. Do you think Trump’s views on trade help explain that political appeal? Why or why not?
- The Trump administration increased tariffs on a wide range of goods at various points during his presidency. Based on the clips, what seem to be the potential benefits of raising tariffs? What are the potential drawbacks?
- Invite students to view this longitudinal public opinion data about whether Americans view global trade as an “opportunity” or a “threat.” Ask them: what trends do you notice? How can you relate them to what you learned about the political developments starting in the mid-2010s? What explanations can you give for why members of both parties became more optimistic about global trade while Trump was in office in the late 2010s? The change after Biden’s election in 2020? 

4)  Divide students into three groups for a “free trade” debate.

- Group 1: supporters of “free trade.” Using evidence and arguments from the clips in this set (and perhaps from supplemental research), students in this group explain the benefits of global trade and why protectionist policies would be misguided.
- Group 2: opponent of “free trade.” Using evidence and arguments from the clips in this set (and perhaps from supplemental research), students in this group argue for the harms that emanate from global trade and argue for policies that more forcefully restrain or restrict trade.
- Group 3: a “jury” of Americans. Members of this group are each assigned a role (e.g. a worker at German-owned car factory in Alabama, owner of a small business that uses imported materials, the leader of a steelworkers’ union, a farmer from the Great Plains, etc.) and they ultimately assess which side’s views are more compelling.

The members of Group 1 (pro-free trade) and Group 2 (free trade skeptics) start by giving some short, pre-written speeches, followed by “extemporaneous” debate where students provide unscripted rebuttals to opposing arguments. Then members of Group 3 (jury) pose questions to the debaters. The debate ends with each jury member explaining which side’s arguments their character would agree with, and why. Afterwards, have an “out of character” debrief in which students can explore what they really believe.
