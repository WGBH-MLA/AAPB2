      <p>Leveraging the valuable digital media in the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, these Multimedia Primary Source Discussion Sets have been curated to support educators teaching topics in US History. They are intended for broad use in educational settings ranging from high school through higher education. By engaging with these digital resources, students will have the opportunity to observe connections between past and present-day events, grow in their understanding of multiple perspectives when considering present-day challenges, and exercise media literacy skills by examining sources for clues about the historical moment in which they were produced.</p>
