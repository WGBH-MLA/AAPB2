## Introduction

The Watergate scandal exposed the widespread political corruption of the Nixon White House during his campaign for re-election as president. As the race tightened, Attorney General John Mitchell and White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman authorized G. Gordon Liddy, a White House operative, to gather intelligence on Nixon’s opponent, Senator George McGovern. Liddy hired the men who burglarized the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., in May and June of 1972 in order to tap the phone of the DNC chairman, Lawrence O’Brien.  On June 17th of that year, five men, including James McCord, the security coordinator for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP or CREEP), were caught and arrested for breaking into the DNC headquarters. With an eye to the November 1972 election, the White House denied any involvement and attacked the press, particularly The Washington Post, for continuing to report on the story and arranged to pay hush money to the burglars. Nixon also ordered Haldeman to use the CIA to halt an FBI investigation into the break-in.

The cover-up started to unravel after the conviction of the Watergate burglars in early 1973, when McCord, to avoid taking the blame for higher-ups, charged that witnesses had committed perjury at the trial. In May, the Senate began a televised investigation into the affair, which soon revealed that Nixon secretly taped Oval Office conversations. Even before the Senate investigation revealed that these recordings existed, John Dean, White House Counsel, testified that Nixon had many conversations about both the break-in and the cover-up. Only the tapes would corroborate the extent of the president’s knowledge and access to this crucial evidence quickly became the focus of the Senate and Department of Justice Watergate investigations. Nixon refused to release the tapes, however, claiming that executive privilege protected his conversations. This triggered both impeachment hearings in the House of Representatives in May 1974 and an appeal to the Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, United States v. Nixon was decided, forcing Nixon to surrender the tapes. The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment the following week. Facing impeachment, the collapse of Republican support, and clear evidence of his complicity, Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.

#### Classroom Activities

**1) The Separation of Powers and Congressional Oversight: Now and Then**

Ask students to watch the following sources:

- [James McCord’s Testimony Before the Senate Select Watergate Committee (1973)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/2-512-d795718g4z)
- [John Dean Testifies Before the Senate Select Watergate Committee (1973)](http://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/3-512-251fj2b06r)
- [Senator Howard Baker Asks John Dean a Key Question (1973)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/4-512-j09w08x77b)
- [Threatened With Impeachment, Nixon Resigns (1983)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/5-9a47dc598f3)

The [Senate hearings ran for 51 days](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/1-512-gf0ms3m89s) over the summer of 1973 and were televised gavel to gavel. Who testified, and what impact do you believe the cooperation of witnesses had on public perceptions? To what degree do you feel the excesses of the Nixon White House lend credence to the notion of an imperial presidency?

How did the members of the House Judiciary Committee approach the impeachment hearings in 1974? Why did so many reference the Constitution and what did they say? Whose remarks resonated with you most and why?

Ask students to read this NPR [article](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/06/1103098399/watergate-committee-hearings-may-be-both-an-inspiration-and-a-hard-act-to-follow) on the January 6 Committee and to compare it to the Watergate hearings in terms of its process and the political make-up of the committees. Identify the factors that differentiated the House of Representatives investigation into the January 6th, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol from the Watergate investigations.

**2)   The Lessons of Watergate**
     
Ask students to watch the following sources: 

- [An Ordinary Citizen Discusses the Morality of Watergate (1974)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/6-512-3f4kk95f7h)
- [Congresswoman Barbara Jordan Reflects on Watergate (1975)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/8-512-ms3jw87z64)
- [Garrett Graff Discusses His Book, Watergate: A New History (2022)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/9-065273f33da)
   
Rep. Barbara Jordan (D, Texas) and Grace Crawley agree that Watergate exposed the lack of integrity and morality in government, but they disagree when it comes to preventing future scandals. What solutions does Jordan endorse?  What does Crawley see as the answer? Garrett Graff, writing on the 50th anniversary of the Watergate break-in, also weighs in. What lesson does he draw from the Watergate scandal?  What lessons do you think should be drawn?

Ask students to put themselves in Crawley’s place: As a citizen in 1974, what would they say in a letter to the editor of Time magazine? What points would they make about political integrity, accountability, and upholding the Constitution?

**3) The Judiciary v. the Executive**
      
Ask students to watch the following sources:

- [The President and the Courts (1973)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/cpb-aacip-9a47dc598f3)
- [Threatened With Impeachment, Nixon Resigns (1983)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/7-512-gm81j9840b)

What role did the Special Prosecutor and the Senate Select Committee play in getting key evidence released? Why did Nixon refuse to surrender the tapes and what specific arguments did he make? Do you find these persuasive? 
 
Imagine you are a lawyer arguing on behalf of the United States in the 1974 [United States v. Nixon](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1973/73-1766) case: What points would you make in order to convince the Supreme Court that President Nixon should surrender all the White House tapes?

**4) Interpreting Watershed Moments**

Ask students to watch:

- [James McCord’s Testimony Before the Senate Select Watergate Committee (1973)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/2-512-d795718g4z)
- [Senator Howard Baker Asks John Dean a Key Question (1973)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/4-512-j09w08x77b)
- [Threatened With Impeachment, Nixon Resigns (1983)](https://americanarchive.org/primary_source_sets/watergate/7-512-gm81j9840b)

Why do you think these were turning points in the Watergate scandal? What made them so dramatic and in what way did they advance the public’s understanding of the inner workings of the Nixon administration?

Political cartoonists like Herblock (Herbert Block), Pat Oliphant, and Draper Hill captured many of the watershed moments of the Watergate scandal in their work. Some of the most memorable were Herblock’s [Watergate cartoons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/cartoon.html)  published in The Washington Post (1972-74).

Using Herblock’s cartoons as a model, ask students to create a political cartoon based on the key events documented by the video sources or others that they identify.

If time permits, create a classroom exhibit based on the cartoons and ask students to lead tours in which they interpret the meaning of the cartoons and explain their historical significance.
