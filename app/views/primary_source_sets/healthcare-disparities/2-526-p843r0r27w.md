## Introduction

Colonias are unincorporated and unregulated low-income communities located within the United States along the Mexican border.  They emerged in the 1950s as an informal housing solution for low-income workers and today there are more than 2,000 of them, with most concentrated in Texas in the Rio Grande Valley.  This video segment is from *Thirst in the Garden*, a documentary produced by KERA-TV, about Hidalgo County, Texas-a productive agricultural community in the Rio Grande Valley that depended on the cheap labor of Mexican-Americans. The documentary highlights the critical role that the absence of indoor plumbing, sewage systems, and limited access to potable water played in the poor health outcomes of the residents, while also capturing the clear indifference of local public health officials.
