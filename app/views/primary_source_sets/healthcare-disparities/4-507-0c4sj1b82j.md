## Introduction

This video segment from *The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer* focuses on the evolution of Medicaid since its creation in 1965. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America’s poorest people and was originally intended to provide health insurance solely for low-income Americans. From the beginning, however, individual states were allowed to set eligibility standards and determine the type, amount, duration, and scope of services.  Medicaid was further modified in the late 1960s and early 1970s to cover elderly and disabled Americans who had fallen into poverty due to their need for long-term care. By 1995, 36 million Americans qualified for Medicaid, but ⅔ of all Medicaid dollars went to elderly and disabled individuals.
