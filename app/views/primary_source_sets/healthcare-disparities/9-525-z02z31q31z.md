## Introduction

The United States maternal mortality rate, at 24 deaths per 100,000 live births, is more than three times the rate in most other high-income countries. In 2018, the National Center for Health Statistics released data on pregnancy-related deaths showing that Black women die 2.5 times more frequently than white women. Since then, there have been growing federal efforts to address disparities in maternal care, culminating with the 2022 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services *Maternity Care Action Plan*. This *PBS NewsHour* video segment explores the high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women in Texas, which was one of 10 states that opted out of Medicaid expansion after the ACA was enacted. 55% of the uninsured population in Texas relies on Medicaid, but postpartum care is cut off 42 days after women give birth.  Poverty and health insurance gaps, however, do not fully explain the scope of the problem. As the segment documents, physician bias in pain assessment and treatment also plays a key role.
