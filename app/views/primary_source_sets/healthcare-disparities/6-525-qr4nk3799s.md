## Introduction

This *PBS NewsHour* video segment illuminates the health implications of food deserts for   
residents of the rural towns of the Mississippi Delta. Healthcare disparities in the U.S.       are driven not only by a lack of access to healthcare providers or insurance gaps but also by environmental and economic factors. It is estimated that more than 23 million Americans live in low-income communities with no easy access to a grocery store. Often gas stations, convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants serve as substitutes for the supermarket. The unavailability of fresh, nutritious food has contributed to the epidemic of obesity in the U.S., and residents in areas marked by food deserts exhibit higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
