## Introduction

This segment from *The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer* shows President Bill Clinton issuing a formal apology to the surviving participants of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Syphilis Study at Tuskegee was conducted between 1932 and 1972 to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis. All of the subjects were Black men, who were offered free medical exams, free meals, and burial insurance in return for their participation.  As part of the study, researchers did not collect informed consent from participants and they did not offer treatment, even after it became widely available. The Tuskegee study was highly unethical and is generally regarded as an example of medical racism.
