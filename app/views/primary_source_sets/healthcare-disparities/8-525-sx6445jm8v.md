## Introduction

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010. Under the provisions of the ACA, any state that participated in Medicaid had to increase coverage to include anyone earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning in 2014. In 2012, in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, the Supreme Court, while affirming the constitutionality of the ACA, ruled that withdrawing all Medicaid funding from states that refused to expand eligibility was unconstitutionally coercive. Thus, many states refused to expand Medicaid eligibility even though, under the ACA, the federal government covered almost all of the cost of expansion. This *PBS NewsHour* video segment examines the impact of Medicaid expansion in Kentucky, which saw a dramatic decrease in its uninsured population after the ACA was enacted. It also covers opposition among state Republicans to Medicaid expansion and the effort to impose a waiver requiring Kentuckians to meet certain work requirements in order to keep their health insurance. In 2019, in his first week in office, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear ended the Medicaid waiver, protecting healthcare for nearly 100,000 state residents.
