## Introduction

As this *PBS NewsHour* video segment depicts, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Native Americans particularly hard: as of February 2021, they had experienced the highest death rate in the U.S., dying at twice the rate of white Americans. Despite this disproportionately high death toll and the high incidence of diabetes and other underlying health conditions among the Native American population, many proved reluctant to get the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The story focuses on the reasons for this, particularly the history of the Federal Indian Health Service sterilizing Indian women without getting their permission in the 1970s and the abuse of Native Americans in medical research. As with African Americans, a history of medical mistreatment resulted in a deep distrust of government-sponsored medical care.
