## Introduction

This video segment from the KOCE-TV series *Jim Cooper’s Orange County* highlights the challenges of providing medical care for the poor, uninsured population of Orange County, California, in the late 1980s. Featuring clinics and public health practitioners, the story focuses on the lack of preventative medical care for the working poor, homeless individuals, immigrants, refugees, and the undocumented due to insurance gaps and shrinking public funds. The healthcare disparities in Orange County, one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, reflected both the limited reach of Medicaid and the growing healthcare crisis.
