## Introduction

Over 1.1 million Americans died from COVID between February 2020 and May 2023, but racial disparities in hospitalizations and deaths were evident early in the pandemic.  As this *PBS NewsHour* story documents, COVID’s toll was also reflected in an alarming decrease in American life expectancy, particularly for Blacks and Latinos. While white life expectancy fell 1.4 years, life expectancy fell 3.2 years for Black Americans and nearly 3.9 years for Latino Americans. As the segment makes clear, the pandemic amplified not only the racial health gap and healthcare disparities, but the nation’s underinvestment in the social determinants of health, especially access to good schools, stable jobs, and safe, clean neighborhoods.
