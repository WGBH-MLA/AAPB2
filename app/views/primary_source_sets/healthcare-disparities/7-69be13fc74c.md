## Introduction

This *PBS NewsHour* video segment delves into the legal fallout and health consequences resulting from the Flint water crisis. Flint, Michigan, is a poor, majority-Black city that fell under state control in 2011. In 2014, Flint switched its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River as a cost-cutting measure. Despite complaints from residents that their water looked, smelled, and tasted foul, these concerns were summarily dismissed by elected officials and public health officers. Later tests revealed that the contaminated water had elevated lead levels, resulting in a doubling of elevated blood-lead levels in children citywide. Studies have shown that even low levels of lead exposure can impair cognitive development in children. Although a coalition of Flint residents sued the state in 2016, and prosecutors eventually brought criminal charges against 11 state and city officials, the story captures how environmental and economic factors drive health inequities and disparities in health outcomes.
