## Introduction

Health insurance and access to medical care do not guarantee equal treatment and the correct diagnosis from physicians. This episode of *Evening Exchange*, a program of Howard University Television (WHUT), looks at the role of bias in medicine. Featured guests include the blues singer Otis Jenkins, a diabetic whose leg was amputated due to poor care, and Dr. Kevin Shulman of Duke University, who designed an experiment which showed that physicians routinely treated cardiac patients differently depending on their race.
