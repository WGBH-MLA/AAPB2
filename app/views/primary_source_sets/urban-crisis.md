## Introduction

In 1976, New Yorkers were “choked with rage” at the “sickness of the city.” *New York Times* journalist Pete Hamill described “rage at the knowledge that the South Bronx was burning to the ground, and we do not have enough firemen. Rage at the plague of crime and violence, knowing we have too few policemen. Rage because so many of our schools and hospitals have been permanently awarded to the rats… rage at the scabrous condition of our streets, the potholes and trenches that may never again be filled, the sewers clogged with a winter’s dismal refuse. Rage at the businessmen fleeing to their suburban arcadias.” 

Americans across the country channeled similar feelings of anger about decaying conditions in their cities, but the issues of the 1970s and early 1980s started long before. The problems were partially rooted in the aftermath of World War II, when predominantly white middle- and upper-class Americans moved out of cities into the suburbs. By the 1970s, the decline of the manufacturing sector led to the elimination of millions of stable, unionized, factory jobs that had once sustained the urban working class. The people who remained in the cities—who were disproportionately poor people of color kept out of the suburbs by formal and informal housing practices—had increasingly gloomy economic prospects, consigned to dead-end jobs or stuck scraping by on welfare. In this environment, the physical infrastructure and social fabric of American cities began to crumble as problems of poverty, crime, violence, and drug addiction grew increasingly dire. And since economic decay and suburban flight undercut the urban tax base, municipal governments struggled to fund the social services to combat these social problems.

As these social dynamics took root in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Americans grappled with the proper political response to the urban crisis. The crime rate had risen significantly, and cities were increasingly viewed as dangerous places in which law-abiding citizens were unsafe. These prevailing attitudes helped fuel “tough on crime” politics in which legislators enacted tougher laws with stricter penalties, while governments shifted fiscal priorities away from social services towards policing. Local, state, and federal governments also wrestled with fiscal debates about taxation and spending. Municipal budgets were in crisis, and urban leaders called for financial support from surrounding suburbs, states, and federal governments. Resistance came from residents and politicians outside distressed cities who felt that they shouldn’t have to “bail out” cities that, in their view, had mismanaged their finances. Thus, the urban crisis had created political conflicts that divided Americans along lines of race, class, and geography.


## Teachingtips

Collectively, the sources capture multiple layers of the urban crisis. The first three clips illuminate some of the structural causes of urban decay. The next three clips portray some of the “symptoms” by depicting bleak conditions in Newark, New York, and Boston. Several more clips speak to the rise in crime and the resulting anger and fear that fueled the War on Crime. The remaining clips lay out the contours of a political debate of the era: should tax revenue collected by federal, state, and nearby local governments be redirected to cities to address the problems of urban decay?  

#### Background Information

Before engaging with this resource set, students should be familiar with the following:

- The rise and maturation of an industrialized economy in the US by the mid-20th Century
- Some understanding of the way power and responsibilities are divided between federal, state, and local governments in the United States

<hr>

#### Essential Question 

What social problems plagued American cities in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and what political debates emerged about how to solve those problems?

<hr>

#### General Discussion Questions
- What were the social, economic, and political forces that contributed to urban decay in the 1970s?
- What were some of the hardships faced by urban residents in the late 1970s and early 1980s?
- How and why did the urban crisis particularly affect African American and Latinos?
- What were some of the political reforms that were proposed or attempted to address the problems of the cities? What might have been the sources of resistance to these efforts?

#### Classroom Activities

1) Ask students to watch the following sources: 

- [Middle Class Exodus to the Suburbs (1966)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/01-516-hx15m6375q)
- [The Struggles of the Auto Industry (1980)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/02-e702335a440)
- [Why Vietnam (1965)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/03-507-gt5fb4xb92)

Then ask them to make a diagram or flowchart to depict the causal processes that created urban decay in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ideally, this schematic should show some of the “chain reactions” that took place in the postwar decades and depict how different causes reinforced each other. Students can either write their maps on paper or use a free concept mapping tool on the internet.

2) Ask students to watch the following sources: 

- [Joblessness and Lack of Opportunity for Black Urban Youth (1983)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/04-526-ns0ks6k995)
- [Urban Decay in the South Bronx (1980)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/05-526-ns0ks6k995)
- [Crisis in Urban Housing Projects (1978)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/06-526-ns0ks6k995)
- [Fear of Crime in American Cities (1979)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/07-507-jq0sq8r907)
- [Political Backlash Against Crime in Newark (1979)](/primary_source_sets/urban-crisis/08-259-sq8qgg2r)

Discuss the following questions: 

- Imagine you lived in a poor neighborhood in one of the cities in this era. What would be hard about growing up in this environment? What would be some opportunities that you might not have that middle-class residents did not have?
- What kinds of explanations for urban problems might have been offered by political liberals? What reforms do you think they might have proposed?
- What kinds of explanations for urban problems might have been offered by political conservatives? What reforms do you think they might have proposed?
- Extension Activity: Ask students to read this *New York Times* summary of President Jimmy Carter’s proposal of a broad federal policy to address problems in American cities. Ask: Which of these proposals do you think would be effective in addressing those problems? Which would not be effective? What criticism might this proposal have faced?

3) Ask students to watch the following sources and then discuss one or more of the questions: 

- [The History and Significance of the Berlin Wall (1981)](/primary_source_sets/cold-war/04-507-k93125r50q)
- [Unrestricted Travels and Free Elections in East Germany (1989)](/primary_source_sets/cold-war/09-507-x639z91909)

According to these sources, how did the Berlin Wall figure into the Cold War? What changes occurred with respect to the Berlin Wall and, more broadly, East-West relations during the years between the two films? What do these sources reveal about the Wall as a physical structure? A symbolic structure? How did different groups view the Berlin Wall? How did different groups experience the Wall? 


**4) Topic: Communism in Europe in the late 1980s**

Ask students to watch the following sources and then discuss one or more of the questions: 

- [Unrestricted Travels and Free Elections in East Germany (1989)](/primary_source_sets/cold-war/09-507-x639z91909)
- [Secretary of State James Baker Discusses the Collapse of the Soviet Union (1995)](/primary_source_sets/cold-war/10-507-5x2599zr5q)

According to these sources, what was the state of communism in Europe during the late 1980s? What accounted for those circumstances? How did U.S. and Western officials interpret these circumstances? How did communist officials view them? How did James Baker’s role as former Secretary of State affect his perspective and conclusions?
