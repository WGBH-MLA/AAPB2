## Introduction

This 2002 clip from The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer presents a series of government officials warning of the potential for imminent terrorist attacks. Tom Ridge, director of the Office of Homeland Security (a new agency created after the 9/11 attacks), tells an audience that “it’s really not a question of if, but a question of when” the next terrorist attack would come. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld emphasizes the threat of enemy governments developing “weapons of mass destruction,” previewing the rationale that would be used to justify the invasion of Iraq. The government regularly updated a color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System that alerted Americans about the risk of terrorist attacks. The news media reported on the threat of potential terrorist plots involving explosives, as well as those involving biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. Several actual events fortified popular fears. In late 2001, numerous letters with the biological weapon anthrax were sent via the U.S. mail, and in December, a man boarded a transatlantic flight and tried but failed to detonate explosives in his shoes. Events such as these combined with governments statements and media attention to reinforce public fears that the next large-scale terrorist attack could come at any time
