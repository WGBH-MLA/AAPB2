## Introduction

The initial invasion of Iraq seemed to promise success for the United States. Using overwhelming air power, the U.S. military quickly toppled the Iraqi regime and forced Saddam Hussein into hiding. The U.S. set up a provisional government and a pathway towards Iraqi elections, and George W. Bush declared that “major combat operations in Iraq have ended” in front of a banner reading “mission accomplished.”  But Sunni Iraqis, who had long held power in Iraq but were displaced by the U.S. occupation and alienated from the process of political reconstruction, launched an insurgency that grew in strength in 2003 and 2004 and made Iraq extremely difficult to govern. Militants attacked the Iraqi Provisional Government, overtook major cities like Fallujah, and ambushed U.S. soldiers. As shown in this panel discussion of American servicemen aired on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer in 2005, soldiers held different opinions about the wisdom and morality of U.S. military actions in Iraq. But there was widespread agreement that the Sunni insurgency posed formidable challenges for American troops.
