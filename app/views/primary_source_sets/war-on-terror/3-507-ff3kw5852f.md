## Introduction

As shown in this report of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, the weeks after September 11 featured a spate of hate crimes perpetrated against people who appeared ethnically similar to the terrorists who carried out the 9/11 attacks. Americans harassed Arabs on the street, vandalized mosques, and one man even murdered a Sikh gas station owner. The panel discussion in the clip shows how many people – including law professors and mainstream political figures – openly called for “profiling” at airports, in which Arabs and Muslims would be subject to additional searches before boarding flights. To be sure, there was also a concerted effort to push back against these impulses. Members of churches and synagogues made a point of demonstrating solidarity with members of nearby mosques, and commentators emphasized that America was a nation of all colors and creeds. In a September 17, 2001, speech, President Bush asserted that the terrorists did not represent the “true faith of Islam,” and urged that Muslim Americans “need to be treated with respect.” Nevertheless, even these explicit statements of tolerance provide evidence that Americans felt it was necessary to push back against a rising tide of suspicion of Muslims, Arabs, and indeed, people whose appearance associated them with the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks.
