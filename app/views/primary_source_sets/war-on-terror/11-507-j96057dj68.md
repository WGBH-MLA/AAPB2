## Introduction

According to a Pew Research Center survey, when the war began in 2003, over 70% of Americans thought invading Iraq was the right decision. By late 2007, that number had fallen to 36%, and opposition to the Iraq War had become a mainstream position in the Democratic Party. While most Republicans continued to support the war, even some conservatives who had formerly defended the war (such as the journalist Rob Dreher, who is featured in this clip) became critics. In this segment of a summer 2007 episode of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, journalists in different parts of the country explain how and why public opinion had turned against the Iraq War.
