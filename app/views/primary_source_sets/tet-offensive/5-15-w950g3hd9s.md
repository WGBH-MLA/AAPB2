## Introduction

During this retrospective interview conducted for the WGBH documentary series *Vietnam: A Television History*, Major General Tran Do explains that North Vietnam sought to “liberate” South Vietnam during the Tet Offensive by occupying major cities and attacking important locations, like the U.S. embassy in Saigon. If they were unable to accomplish that primary goal, they sought to weaken U.S. and South Vietnamese forces.
