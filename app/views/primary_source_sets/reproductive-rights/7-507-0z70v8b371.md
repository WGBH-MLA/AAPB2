## Introduction

  Although mifepristone (formerly RU-486) was widely available in Europe for over a decade, the FDA’s approval of the medication fell victim to abortion politics in the United States until 2000.  Part of a two-pill regimen, mifepristone offered the first medical alternative to surgical abortions in the United States and greatly expanded access to abortion. This segment from _The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer_ covers the history of the approval process and the reactions of both Planned Parenthood and the National Right to Life Committee to the FDA’s decision.
