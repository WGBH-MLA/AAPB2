## Introduction

Three years after _Roe v. Wade_ was decided, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which barred the use of federal Medicaid funds for abortion except when the life of the woman would be endangered by carrying the pregnancy to term. This segment from The MacNeil/Lehrer Report showcases the reasoning of Congressman Robert Bauman (R, MD), who explains his opposition to using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions.
