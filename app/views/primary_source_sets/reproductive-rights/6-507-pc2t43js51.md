## Introduction

Operation Rescue, the fundamentalist Christian organization founded in 1986 by Randall Terry, revitalized the right-to-life movement by adopting the non-violent tactics of the civil rights movement. This video clip from _The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour_ shows Terry rallying his troops and leading Operation Rescue volunteers as they blocked access to the Margaret Sanger Clinic in Manhattan.
