## Introduction

Following the _Casey_ ruling in 1992, state legislatures passed numerous laws   restricting medically unnecessary abortions with provisions that abandoned the trimester framework, banned specific abortion methods, imposed mandatory waiting periods or physician counseling, limited access to medication abortion, and limited who could provide abortion healthcare. In 2018, Mississippi passed the Gestational Age Act, which banned abortion after 15 weeks. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization responded by suing the state, and the case eventually arrived at the Supreme Court. This _PBS NewsHour_ segment covers the arguments made before the Court as it considered the role of legal precedent and the issue of fetal viability.  On June 24th, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in the _Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health_ case, overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion.
