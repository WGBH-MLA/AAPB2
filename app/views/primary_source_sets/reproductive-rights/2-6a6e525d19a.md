## Introduction

This episode of the _Backstory_ podcast focuses on the story of Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in _Roe v. Wade_, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that codified the constitutional right to an abortion. The segment delves into both the restrictive abortion laws in Texas that drove women to seek illegal abortions and that prompted the lawsuit, and the legal arguments underpinning the decision, particularly a womenâ€™s right to privacy.
