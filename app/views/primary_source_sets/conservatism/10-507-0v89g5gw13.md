## Introduction

Arguably the most significant political development of the late 1970s was the successful mobilization of the “Religious Right.” The ranks of evangelical conservatives were growing quickly, but the group had not traditionally had a strong partisan bent or particularly high levels of political participation. Thanks in part to political leaders like Minister Jerry Falwell, however, these voters increasingly rallied behind conservative candidates. They saw evidence for the declining influence of Christian morality throughout the public sphere: Supreme Court rulings establishing abortion as a constitutional right and banning prayer in public schools; increasing rates of divorce and childbirth out of wedlock; the rising visibility of homosexuality; and the growing accessibility of pornography. In this 1980 episode of The MacNeil/Lehrer Report, Jerry Falwell explains the efforts of his political advocacy organization, “The Moral Majority.”
