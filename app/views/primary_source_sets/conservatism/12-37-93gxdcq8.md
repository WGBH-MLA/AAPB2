## Introduction

Ronald Reagan’s presidential victory in 1980 marked a new epoch in American political history. Reagan won 44 states and Jimmy Carter won fewer electoral votes than any sitting president since Herbert Hoover. Reagan succeeded by tying together different strands of an emerging Republican coalition: social conservatives concerned by what they saw as the erosion of moral behavior; fiscal conservatives who desired reduced spending and taxation; foreign policy hawks seeking a muscular foreign policy; and “law and order” advocates who wanted a tougher approach to crime. Reagan’s charismatic persona undoubtedly helped him as well, and he had a knack for delivering the pithy one-liner. One of Reagan’s most famous turns of phrase comes from this inauguration speech, in which he declared that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” In this excerpt, Reagan makes the case for lower government spending and taxation, which he contends would bring economic prosperity and protect the freedom of the American people.
