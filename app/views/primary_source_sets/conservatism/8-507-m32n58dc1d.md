## Introduction

In the 1970s, American urban centers were reeling as a result of deindustrialization and rising inflation, and municipal governments struggled to maintain funding of social services as increasing numbers of affluent, white residents had moved to the suburbs. This economic decay helps explain why the U.S. faced a steadily rising rate of violent and property crime during the decade, leading many Americans to fear that the streets of major urban centers were no longer safe. Politicians from both parties adopted “tough on crime” policies to seize on public fears (and in some cases, exacerbate those fears with their rhetoric). The crime issue proved politically useful for politicians on the political right, who argued that liberal social policies purportedly aimed at dealing with root causes of crime had failed. Instead, what was needed was greater enforcement and stricter punishment, with less “attention to the rights of the accused” and more attention to the rights of citizens who were “brutally victimized, day after day after day.” Those words came from Republican President Gerald Ford in a 1976 election campaign speech given to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, captured in this episode of The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.
