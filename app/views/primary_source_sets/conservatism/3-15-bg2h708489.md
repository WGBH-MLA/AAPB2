## Introduction

By 1971, around three-fifths of Americans came to believe that the U.S. made a mistake by sending troops to Vietnam. In this respect, the antiwar position had majority support, but some of the tactics used by antiwar activists did not. In this clip from a 1971 episode of a debate-style WGBH show called The Advocates, both men engaged in argument were staunch critics of the Vietnam War. Rennie Davis was a prominent antiwar activist (and one of the “Chicago Seven” tried for organizing antiwar protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention). Davis’s case for massive civil disobedience is challenged by Roger Fisher, a law professor who advocated for withdrawal from Vietnam but disagreed with the use of disruptive tactics that might antagonize moderate voters and legislators. Fisher presents an analytical perspective that many historians have used to understand Nixon’s victories in 1968 and 1972; by shifting the focus of political debate from the unpopular Vietnam War to unpopular tactics of some antiwar protestors, Nixon was able to run as a “law and order” candidate who spoke for the “silent majority” of Americans.
