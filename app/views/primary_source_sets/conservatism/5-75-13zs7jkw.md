## Introduction

George Wallace, the one-time segregationist governor of Alabama, mounted a third-party run for president in 1968 that attracted 13.5% of the popular vote. According to some historians, many Wallace voters were former Democrats frustrated by racial equality legislation that they believed reached too far. The Black Freedom Struggle had successfully pressured for federal legislation that outlawed segregation in public accommodations and employment discrimination and protected Black voting rights. While those laws focused largely on the South, two other policies focused on racial inequality that was particularly pronounced in the North: The Civil Rights Act of 1968 made it illegal to refuse to sell or rent to a person on the basis of race; and school desegregation programs sought to achieve racial balance in urban school systems by busing Black students to white schools and vice versa. In this interview, from a 1968 episode of NET Journal, Wallace uses carefully race-neutral language to mount critiques of open housing laws and busing desegregation policies as forms of government overreach. Historians like Jefferson Cowie argue that Wallaceâ€™s rhetoric provided a roadmap for how to attract certain white voters away from the Democratic Party.
