## Introduction

During the mid-1970s, the United States economy faced its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The country faced “stagflation,” an economic slowdown that featured high unemployment, wage stagnation, and a soaring inflation rate. Two-term governor of California Ronald Reagan argued that reducing the size of government would revive the U.S. economy. In this excerpt from a 1974 interview on the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) series Washington Straight Talk, Reagan argues that bloated government agencies could be run more efficiently by reducing staff. He contends that welfare spending could be reduced by eliminating a substantial amount of fraud he claimed was committed by applicants who understated their income.
