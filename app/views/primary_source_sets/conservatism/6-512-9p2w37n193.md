## Introduction

In an episode of the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) series A Public Affair aired in the runup to the 1972 election, political commentators analyze emerging coalitional shifts in American politics. The Democratic Party had enjoyed control of Congress for nearly all of the previous four decades, owing in significant part to the “New Deal Coalition” of white southerners, organized labor, and ethnic and racial minorities. However, both political analysts highlighted in this clip point to ways that politics of the late 1960s and early 1970s was upending this balance of power.  Democratic political operative Fred Dutton describes an emerging “coalition of conscience” driven by a growing voting population of young people and Black Americans. While this “New Left” was undeniably a formidable political force in this era, Republican strategist Kevin Phillips’s vision of a “Republican Majority” proved more prescient. He describes an “old morality” coalition that included formerly Democratic constituencies, such as white southern voters and urban Catholics. Indeed, soon after this program aired, Republican Richard Nixon won a landslide victory over George McGovern that included a sweep of the South and majority support from union members.
