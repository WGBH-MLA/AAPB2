## Introduction

The 1960s are famous for the proliferation of left-wing social movements, but the decade also saw grassroots mobilization on the political right. Right-wing organizations in suburban America supported conservatives for local office, fought for control of school boards, and held workshops to educate citizens about the benefits of free market capitalism. One particularly controversial organization was the John Birch Society, a political advocacy group founded by Robert Welch and made up of dozens of local chapters devoted to exposing and combating supposed Communist infiltration in influential American institutions. In a 1965 episode of the National Educational Television series Regional Report focused on the John Birch Society, a suburban Boston chapter holds a special meeting for the benefit of the cameras. In the clip, the chapter leader articulates key aspects of the “Bircher” worldview: that the United Nations and the Civil Rights Movement were both vehicles for Communist influence, and the Supreme Court was undermining sacred American freedoms and principles.
