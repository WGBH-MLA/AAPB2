## Introduction

In this segment of a 1963 episode of the National Education Television series Perspectives entitled “The American Conservative,” three prominent political figures are asked to define conservatism’s contribution to the nation. For the previous three decades, the Democratic Party had dominated national politics, controlling Congress for all but four years. During the Great Depression and World War II, Democrats had crafted a “New Deal Order” in which spending on social programs and taxation had significantly increased. Responding to these trends, the three speakers in the clip define key tenets of postwar conservatism: a muscular foreign policy devoted to stopping the spread of communism abroad and the goal of reversing the expansion of overbearing government at home by curbing “socialistic” welfare state programs.
