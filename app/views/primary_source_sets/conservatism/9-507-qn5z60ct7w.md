## Introduction

The Gay Liberation Movement had succeeded in enhancing the visibility of LGBTQ+ people and securing the removal of many discriminatory policies. Additionally, numerous local governments passed laws that banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing, employment, and public accommodations. In 1977, Dade County (the Florida county that includes Miami) passed such a law, leading to the decade’s biggest political battle over gay rights. The “Save Our Children” campaign, headed by singer and born-again Christian Anita Bryant, led the effort to repeal the anti-discrimination law through a public referendum. The campaign played to many residents’ fears that the law would turn Miami into a “hotbed of homosexuality” that would threaten their children. This 1977 MacNeil/Lehrer Report segment, recorded just before the Save Our Children campaign successfully repealed the ordinance, features political advertisements from both sides and an interview with Anita Bryant.
