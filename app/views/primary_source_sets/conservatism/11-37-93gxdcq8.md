## Introduction

The final years of the Carter Presidency became known by many commentators as a time of national malaise. Troubling developments in international affairs–most prominently the Iran Hostage Crisis, in which Americans were held captive for over a year by anti-American revolutionaries–seemed to demonstrate U.S. impotence on the world stage. Meanwhile, spiking gas prices and soaring inflation led to economic frustration. Carter himself described how Americans were suffering from a “crisis of confidence.” Ronald Reagan, however, portrayed himself as a leader who could restore American military strength and the country’s role as leader of the free world. In this section of his 1981 Inauguration speech, Reagan proclaims that the United States would resume its crucial role as “the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope” for the rest of the world. Many historians argue that, in a time of national crisis, Reagan’s ability to convey a sense of optimism, renewal and sense of national purpose helped explain his political appeal.
