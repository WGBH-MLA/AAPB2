## Introduction

This audio is from Native American activist John Trudell’s KPFA (Berkeley, CA) radio program *Radio Free Alcatraz*, which had just begun broadcasting the previous week. Reporting from Alcatraz Island during the All Tribes occupation of the island, Trudell (Santee Sioux) interviews Sioux Indian and University of California-Berkeley student Burnell Blindman. Trudell and Blindman discuss conditions on Indian reservations, and the Alcatraz occupation and its goals.
