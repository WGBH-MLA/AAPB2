## Introduction

In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the disease was associated primarily with gay men. Indeed, it was initially referred to as GRID, the Gay Related Immunodeficiency Syndrome, and sometimes colloquially as a “gay plague.”  However, since HIV is a bloodborne pathogen that can spread in numerous ways (homosexual or heterosexual sex, intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, etc.), the disease ultimately spread to Americans of all races, genders, and sexualities.  As shown on this special program that aired on Howard University’s public TV station (Washington, DC), a major theme in AIDS education was to emphasize that there are “only high-risk activities” not “high-risk groups.”
