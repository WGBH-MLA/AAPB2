## Introduction

While cities as a whole suffered from economic challenges, the problems tended to be especially stark in deindustrialized neighborhoods populated by impoverished people of color. Perhaps the poster child for urban decay was the South Bronx section of New York City. By many accounts, this was the poorest area in the country. According to author Jeff Chang, by the late 1970s, the per capita income was 40% below the national average and the official youth unemployment rate was 60%. And the urban decay was tangible: buildings were abandoned, collapsed, or in a state of disrepair. Arson became a commonplace fact of life, with thousands of buildings set ablaze in the 1970s. The fires were set by various parties: frustrated tenants, landlords who viewed insurance payouts as more lucrative than collecting rent, and neighborhood residents when a 1977 blackout led to a night of looting and unrest. The South Bronx provided an extreme example of the problems facing cities across the country: having suffered from deindustrialization (the Bronx lost 600,000 manufacturing jobs in the decades after World War II) and white, middle-class suburban flight. As one New York official sardonically noted, “In a marvelous, sad way, the South Bronx is an enormous success story.  Over 750,000 people have left in the past twenty years for middle class success in the suburbs.” But, of course, the impoverished Black and Latino people who were stuck in the decaying community enjoyed no such success. This clip from a 1980 episode of *Bill Moyers Journal*, entitled “The Fire Next Door,” documents the miserable living conditions endured by the remaining residents of the South Bronx.
