## Introduction

The largest American urban centers of the mid-20th century were built around manufacturing, so these urban centers suffered when the industrial workforce started contracting in the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s, American companies that made cars, steel, televisions, shoes, and many other goods lost market share to companies in other countries. As a result, thousands of factories closed. Perhaps even more significantly, advancements in automation meant that the remaining factories needed far fewer workers to achieve similar productivity levels. Detroit, which had risen as a center of the American auto industry, provides a prime example of this trend of “deindustrialization.” As seen in this 1980 episode of *Bill Moyers Journal*, thousands of auto workers lost their jobs as automation and global competition drove these businesses to restructure their operations. Increasingly, production that had once been done by unionized Detroit laborers was being outsourced to other countries or performed by robots. The steep rise in unemployment would devastate Detroit’s economy, and the impact on the city was calamitous: In 1950, Detroit was the fifth-largest city in the US, with 1.85 million residents. Between 1950 and 1980, Detroit lost one-third of its total population, and a million white residents left the city. Meanwhile, the suburban population of Wayne County lying outside Detroit nearly doubled. Thus, Detroit provides an extreme form of a pattern of deindustrialization and white flight that would play out in major cities across the country.
