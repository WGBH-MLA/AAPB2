## Introduction

In the mid-twentieth century, cities across the country built giant public housing projects to house low-income residents. The goal was to replace deteriorating slums that had traditionally housed the urban poor. Notably, suburbs were largely successful in fighting efforts to build public housing outside of inner cities, and by the 1960s and 1970s, complexes were typically heavily racially segregated. Additionally, gathering the poor in high-rise apartments concentrated the problems associated with extreme poverty in one densely packed location. The problems of entrenched poverty only got worse with deindustrialization and the collapse of urban economies. As a result, housing projects became riddled with gang activity, drug dealing, and violence, and were deployed as symbols of the failure of government anti-poverty efforts. The problems in Boston’s Columbia Point Housing Project were explored in this 1978 episode of *The MacNeil Lehrer Report* entitled “What to Do with the Failures in Public Housing: Fix Them Up, or Tear 'Em Down?"
