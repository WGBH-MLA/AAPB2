## Introduction

During the mid-to-late 1970s, a number of cities ended up in dire financial straits as their spending outpaced their revenue. For example, this 1978 episode of *The MacNeil/Lehrer Report* documented how the city of Cleveland was in danger of defaulting on loans, and officials considered unattractive options of laying off municipal workers and raising taxes. Dozens of cities, including New York and Detroit, faced similar problems, and mayors lobbied President Carter and Washington, D.C. legislators to provide federal funding to keep their budgets afloat. Critics argued that the cities’ problems were a result of municipal mismanagement, political corruption, and unreasonable demands made by government worker unions. Defenders of cities argued that budget problems were an inevitable result of deindustrialization, affluent flight to the suburbs, and more generally, the unfair expectations of providing significant social services despite having limited taxing authority. In this excerpt, panelists with competing views debate whether it was appropriate for the federal government to provide aid to struggling cities.
