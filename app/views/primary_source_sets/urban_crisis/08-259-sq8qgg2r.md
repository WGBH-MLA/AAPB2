## Introduction

Newark, New Jersey, provided an archetype of urban decay in this era. According to a 1976 report by the New Jersey Economic Council, the state lost 110,000 manufacturing jobs—almost one-quarter of its manufacturing workforce—between 1953 and 1975. Many of those workers were from the former industrial center of Newark.  By 1980, [unemployment in the fading industrial center rose above 13% and the poverty rate rose above 30%](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.nj.gov/transportation/works/njchoices/pdf/newark.pdf?). As joblessness rose in Newark, so did crime. In 1980, [Newark police recorded over 11,000 violent crimes](https://www.disastercenter.com/newjersy/crime/8541.htm?), resulting in a per capita rate that was [more than five times the national average estimated by the FBI](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180620_R45236_2331bb4395e5bc18cafc200727ecad1748db8880.html?).

This 1979 *New Jersey Nightly News* report is evidence of how some politicians used the crime issue to mobilize supporters—often along racial lines. The [city’s racial composition had changed as dramatically](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2005/demo/POP-twps0076.pdf) as its economic base: in 1950, Newark was 83% white and 17% Black; by 1980, just 31% of residents were white and 58% were Black. In this clip, two white politicians in Newark—Anthony Imperiale and Anthony Carrino—both claim to speak for the “decent people” of Newark who are tired of being victimized by a criminal class. Notably, their criticisms are largely aimed at the administration of Kenneth Gibson, Newark’s first Black mayor, arguing that the local government needs to do more to stop crime.
