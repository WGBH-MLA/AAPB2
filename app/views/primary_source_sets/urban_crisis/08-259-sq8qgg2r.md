## Introduction

Newark, New Jersey, provided an archetype of urban decay in this era. According to a 1976 report by the New Jersey Economic Council, the state lost 110,000 manufacturing jobs—almost one-quarter of its manufacturing workforce—between 1953 and 1975. Many of those workers were from the former industrial center of Newark. By the end of the decade, unemployment in the fading industrial center rose to 13%, the poverty rate rose above 30%, and the city’s white population fell by over 50%. In 1980, Newark housed only 4% of the state's population, but was responsible for 9% of all reported crime. This 1979 *New Jersey Nightly News* report is evidence of how some politicians used the “crime issue” to mobilize supporters and exacerbate racial and ethnic divides. In this clip, two Italian American politicians in Newark—Anthony Imperiale and Anthony Carrino—both claim to speak for the “decent people” of Newark who are tired of being victimized by a criminal class. Notably, their criticisms are largely aimed at the administration of Kenneth Gibson, Newark’s first Black mayor, arguing that the local government needs to do more to stop crime.
