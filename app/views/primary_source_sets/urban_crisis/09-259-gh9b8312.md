## Introduction

During the Urban Crisis, cities' social and economic trends decimated the urban tax base. Manufacturing jobs in cities disappeared at the same time as higher income residents moved to the suburbs. Cities could only tax within their boundaries, and the money was moving out of city limits. Thus, cities endured growing poverty-associated problems (such as crime, violence, and addiction) at the same time as they were losing the revenue needed to fund social services that addressed these problems. As conditions in cities got worse and worse, most anyone with the means to move to the suburbs did so, leaving only the poorest residents stuck in the decaying cities. For many reformers, the solution was to design schemes to reallocate tax revenue. If some money raised from surrounding suburban areas, states, and the federal government could be funneled back into cities, urban areas would have the resources to deal with social problems and revitalize their economies. This clip, from a 1976 episode of the *New Jersey Nightly News*, introduces one such set of reforms proposed by the State Economic Policy Council.
