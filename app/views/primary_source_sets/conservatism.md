## Introduction

In the early 1960s, conservatism appeared to be a marginal force in American political life. Despite the existence of an enthusiastic network of grassroots right-wing organizations and victories in the several states in the Deep South, conservative Barry Goldwater suffered a landslide defeat to Democrat Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 presidential race. But just four years later, Republican Richard Nixon won a decisive presidential victory. He campaigned as a “law and order” candidate, claiming to speak for Americans who were tired of urban rioting and disruptive protests against the Vietnam War, a constituency he later designated “the silent majority.” Many historians argue that this message attracted blue collar white voters who had historically been part of the Democratic “New Deal Coalition.” Nixon also adopted a “southern strategy” focused on appealing to white southerners using race-neutral terms like “states’ rights,” designed to appeal to racial fears and resentments.  In his electoral rout in the 1972 presidential election, Nixon won deep southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia by more than 40 points.
Nixon’s scandal-induced resignation in 1974 proved politically damaging for the Republican Party in the short term, but the conservative movement was able to rebuild momentum in the late 1970s. Leaders of the “Religious Right” rallied voters who were concerned with what they saw as declining influence of Christian morality in American society. Conservative politicians also sought to provide an answer to Americans angered by rising crime and economic “stagflation” (a combination of stagnating economic growth and inflation). Amidst growing frustration in international affairs (exemplified by the government’s inability to resolve the Iran Hostage Crisis), so-called “neo-conservatives” called for the renewal of an assertive foreign policy in pursuit of the United States’ national interest. Politicians like Ronald Reagan argued that the liberal vision of an expansive government devoted to the provision of social programs and to leveling social inequities had failed; the post-Vietnam retreat from assertion of American power on the world stage had also endangered the country. Championing a different role for government focused on promoting strong national defense, Christian morality, personal responsibility, and free market capitalism, Reagan wove together strands of a new Republican coalition that would deliver him two landslide presidential victories in 1980 and 1984. A half century after the triumph of Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, this Reagan Revolution marked a new epoch in American politics.
