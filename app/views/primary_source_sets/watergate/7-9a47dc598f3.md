## Introduction

The President and the Courts

<b> The President and the Courts (1973) </b>
<b> This special episode from the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) on Nixon’s legal battles aired in the summer of 1973. It recaps Alexander Butterfield’s explosive testimony that there was a voice-activated White House taping system and the legal battle that ensued after Nixon refused to surrender the tapes when subpoenaed. Nixon’s reasoning that protecting the confidentiality of presidential conversations would preserve the institution of the presidency was central to his defense and to his assertion of executive privilege. </b>
