## Introduction

The star witness of the Watergate hearings proved to be John Dean, the White House Counsel from 1970-73, who testified to numerous examples of the Nixon Administration's attempt to cover up the Watergate break-in. In this clip, Dean describes his March 21, 1973, meeting with Nixon where he informed the president of the deep involvement of the White House in the Watergate cover-up, the legal risks of turning a blind eye to perjury and escalating demands for hush money, calling them a “cancer on the presidency.”
