## Introduction

In February, 1973, the Senate established the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate the Watergate affair. The question became: would Nixon and his staff appear before the committee? In this video excerpt from public television’s gavel-to-gavel coverage of the hearings, James McCord, the former Security Director for the Committee to Re-elect the President, reveals both the administration’s involvement in the Watergate break-in and cover-up and its efforts to silence him. McCord was the first Nixon staffer to break ranks.
