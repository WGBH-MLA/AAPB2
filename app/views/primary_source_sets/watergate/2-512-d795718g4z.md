## Introduction

James McCord’s Testimony Before the Senate Select Watergate Committee (1973)

<b> James McCord’s Testimony Before the Senate Select Watergate Committee (1973)</b>
<b> In February, 1973, the Senate established the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate the Watergate affair. The question became: would Nixon and his staff appear before the committee? In this video excerpt from public television’s gavel-to-gavel coverage of the hearings, James McCord, the former Security Director for the Committee to Re-elect the President, reveals both the administration’s involvement in the Watergate break-in and cover-up and its efforts to silence him. McCord was the first Nixon staffer to break ranks.</b>
<i> Start: 00:43 ([music] In the Senate of the United States…) | End: 3:50 (...within a year’s time)</i>
