## Introduction

Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer anchor gavel-to-gavel coverage of day 12 of the U.S. Senate Watergate hearings. In today's hearing, John Dean testifies.

<b> John Dean Testifies Before the Senate Select Watergate Committee (1973) </b>
<b> The star witness of the Watergate hearings proved to be John Dean, the White House Counsel from 1970-73, who testified to numerous examples of the Nixon Administration's attempt to cover up the Watergate break-in. In this clip, Dean describes his March 21, 1973, meeting with Nixon where he informed the president of the deep involvement of the White House in the Watergate cover-up, the legal risks of turning a blind eye to perjury and escalating demands for hush money, calling them a “cancer on the presidency.” </b>
<i> Start: 07:20 (As I have indicated…) | End: 14:45 (...from further involvement.) </i>
