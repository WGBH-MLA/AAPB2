## Introduction

Senator Howard Baker, a Republican and Vice Chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee, poses a key question for his fellow committee members as well as the viewing audience: What did the president know and when did he know it? Deanâ€™s response implicates both Nixon and his staff in the cover-up and efforts to derail the investigation of the Watergate break-in. This was a key moment in the televised hearings.
