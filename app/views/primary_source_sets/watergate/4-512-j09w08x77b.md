## Introduction

Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer anchor gavel-to-gavel coverage of day 15 of the U.S. Senate Watergate hearings. In today's hearing, John Dean testifies.

<b> Senator Howard Baker Asks John Dean a Key Question (1973) </b>
<b> Senator Howard Baker, a Republican and Vice Chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee, poses a key question for his fellow committee members as well as the viewing audience: What did the president know and when did he know it? Dean’s response implicates both Nixon and his staff in the cover-up and efforts to derail the investigation of the Watergate break-in. This was a key moment in the televised hearings. </b>
<i> Start: 1:02:38 (There’s one other thing… | End:  1:08:43 (...going into the president.) </i>
