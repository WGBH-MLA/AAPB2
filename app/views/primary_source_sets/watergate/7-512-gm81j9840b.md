## Introduction

Summer Of Judgement: The Watergate Hearings; Part 2 of 2

<b> Threatened With Impeachment, Nixon Resigns (1983) </b>
<b> This excerpt from a 1983 WETA (Washington, D.C.) documentary on Watergate, Summer of Judgment, covers the mounting political pressure Nixon faced in July, 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that he had to surrender the White House tapes in United States v. Nixon, and Republican support collapsed. Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, after the tapes that were released to the public documented his knowledge of the Watergate break-in and cover-up. </b>
