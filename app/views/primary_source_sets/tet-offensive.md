## Introduction

On January 30, 1968, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) launched a series of attacks across South Vietnam against key cities, district and provincial capitals, hamlets, every major American base, and the U.S. embassy.  Because the campaign occurred during the Vietnamese lunar new year celebration of Tet, the attacks became known as the Tet Offensive. The Tet Offensive was the largest military operation of the war to date. Although Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces achieved initial victories, they were ultimately repelled, in some cases after weeks of fighting. Although the Tet Offensive was a military defeat for the Viet Cong and NVA, it had far-reaching consequences. The American public was shocked by television coverage of the attacks, especially since officials from the U.S. government and military had been touting the success of U.S. military operations in Vietnam. This coverage helped to turn public opinion in the U.S. against the war effort.
