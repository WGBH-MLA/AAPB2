## Introduction

In 1968, Native Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota, launched the American Indian Movement (AIM), which was an activist group that grew into a larger movement centered on tribal sovereignty and self-governance. The founding of AIM occurred within the context of what is often referred to as the “social revolution” of the 1960s, which involved grassroots activism across multiple groups and issues, including civil and labor rights, sexual identity and freedom, and opposition to the Vietnam War. AIM grew out of Native Americans’ opposition to and experience of federal Indian policy that pushed Indians to assimilate and dislocated them from tribal lands. AIM garnered national attention for its high-profile, lengthy protests, often characterized as militant. As a result of AIM’s principles and protests, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) targeted the movement and its members through COINTELPRO, its counterintelligence program that used covert and illegal actions to eliminate groups the FBI deemed subversive. However, AIM protests also moved the federal government to recognize certain tribal land rights and support Indian education.
