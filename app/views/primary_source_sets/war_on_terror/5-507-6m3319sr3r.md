## Introduction

On September 20, 2001, George W. Bush convened a joint session of Congress to deliver a speech to the nation. In his address (as originally broadcast live on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer), he lays out key features that would continue to define the War on Terror during his time in office. The war would not just focus on those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, but on every “terrorist group of global reach.” And beyond that, we would not only target terrorist organizations, but any government that “harbors or supports” them. The speech also lays out key ideological premises, framing the War on Terror as an effort to protect “freedom” against an enemy associated with “fascism” and “terrorism.” Bush also calls for international support for U.S. efforts by laying out a stark dichotomy: “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.”
