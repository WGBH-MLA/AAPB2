## Introduction

When the U.S. invaded Afghanistan within weeks of the September 11 attacks in order to seek Osama bin Laden and replace the Taliban with a new government, the U.S. public and international community offered widespread support. However, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in early 2003 was far more controversial. The Bush Administration argued that Iraqâ€™s authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and that there were links between his government and al-Qaeda.  However, relatively few allies joined the U.S. in the Iraqi military campaign, and a significant, outspoken minority of Americans opposed the invasion.  In this panel discussion, aired on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer just days before the U.S. launched its invasion, various commentators debate the morality and wisdom of the war in Iraq. In this clip, historian and left-wing activist Howard Zinn spars with diplomatic historian Diane Kunz.
