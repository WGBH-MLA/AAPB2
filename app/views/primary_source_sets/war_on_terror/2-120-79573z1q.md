## Introduction

It is difficult to neatly summarize how Americans responded to the tragic events of 9/11. Different people reacted in different ways, and each individual experienced a complex mix of emotions. Common responses included shock, anger, confusion, grief, fear, and despair. There were also widely attended commemorative events at which Americans expressed collective solidarity, as well as spontaneous demonstrations of gratitude towards “first responders” (firefighters and police officers who rushed into the burning buildings to save victims). This report from OnQ, a news magazine produced by WQED in Pittsburgh, shows some of the most common American responses in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks: a surge in expressions of patriotism, and a desire for retaliation.
