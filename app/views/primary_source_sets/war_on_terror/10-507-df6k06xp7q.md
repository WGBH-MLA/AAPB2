## Introduction

Despite only amounting to around one-fifth of the population, Sunni Arabs had controlled Iraqi politics for decades, including during the rule of Saddam Hussein. However, upon occupying the country, the U.S. disbanded the Iraqi military and removed all members of Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party from the government. Especially once democratic elections gave the Shia majority a strong hold on power, disaffected Sunni often joined the insurgency. So too did al-Qaeda extremists, who were able to gain a following in Iraq by playing to Sunni grievances against the U.S. occupation. Already brewing tensions and violence between Sunni and Shia Iraqis exploded in early 2006 after al-Qaeda bombed the Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, one of holiest sites in Shia Islam.  On this February 23, 2006, episode of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, aired immediately after the mosque bombing, two Middle East experts express concern that the attack would lead to intensified sectarian violence. Indeed, the Al-Askari bombing is often considered the beginning of a Sunni-Shia civil war that led to tens of thousands of civilian deaths and marked the bloodiest years of the U.S. occupation.
