## Introduction

Around six weeks after the September 11 attacks, the U.S Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, a law that expanded the government’s power to conduct surveillance on U.S. citizens.  To simplify the impact of a complex law, the Patriot Act made it easier for the government to surveil U.S. citizens during investigations into terrorism (e.g., conduct searches, obtain personal library records, and view phone and internet activity) with minimal judicial oversight. In 2003, amidst renewed debate about a proposed expansion of the law, the NewsHour aired this report on the Patriot Act and a debate between Columbia Law Professor Patricia Williams and University of California–Berkeley Law Professor John Yoo (who had also served in the Justice Department as a key legal defender of the Bush Administration’s expansive counterterrorism policies).
