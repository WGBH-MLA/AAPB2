## Introduction

While many Americans witnessed the September 11 terrorist attacks firsthand, the vast majority experienced the tragedy as a media event. Glued to their television sets, Americans endured tragic and surreal images and descriptions of the day’s devastating events. In the early evening, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer put together this chronology of the day’s events, combining footage of the burning and collapsing towers, scenes of people fleeing the scene, interviews with horrified eyewitnesses and official statements from President Bush.
