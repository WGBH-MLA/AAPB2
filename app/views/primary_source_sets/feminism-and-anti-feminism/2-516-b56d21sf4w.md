This clip highlights how women became involved in running for political office and, through tenacious sacrifice, created roles for themselves in a “man’s world.” For example, Representative Frances Bolton entered politics after her husband died in office and Clare Boothe Luce transitioned from Congress into a presidential administration as Ambassador to Italy.
