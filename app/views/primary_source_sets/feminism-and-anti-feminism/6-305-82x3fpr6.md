## Introduction

Often credited as one of the leading figures in “second-wave feminism,” activist and writer Betty Friedan was best known for her book, *The Feminine Mystique*, which discussed the dissatisfaction that mainstream, white American women had in trying to find fulfillment solely as wives and mothers. A graduate of Smith College, she addressed the graduating class of 1981, warning the newly-minted graduates to be wary of the idea of being “superwomen.”
