## Introduction

The first Black woman elected to the United States Congress, Shirley Chisholm was an outspoken advocate for women and people of color during her seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In this clip, Chisholm never directly speaks of gender inequality; instead, she encourages graduates to fulfill their responsibility to positively change society.
