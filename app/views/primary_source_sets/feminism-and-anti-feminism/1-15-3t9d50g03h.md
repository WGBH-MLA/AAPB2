## Introduction

In this clip, Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and President John F. Kennedy discuss the importance of having more women serve in higher public office and traditionally male dominated fields, such as medicine. Roosevelt also points out international differences in childcare, and how a lack of intergenerational childcare is a hindrance for American women trying to balance careers. As you watch, consider the types of problems facing women that are identified in the reel just prior to the interview.
