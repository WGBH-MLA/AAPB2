## Introduction

An excerpt from the series “Of People and Politics” follows Republican Presidential candidate Senator Margaret Chase Smith during her campaign in the 1964 Illinois primary election. “Women’s proper place is everywhere,” Smith states in a speech on the campaign trail. As Smith discusses the “proper place for women,” she argues that women belong in all spheres where decisions are made, but emphasizes that women need to seek those opportunities for themselves.
