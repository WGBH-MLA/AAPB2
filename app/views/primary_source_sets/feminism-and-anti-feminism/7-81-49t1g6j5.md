## Introduction

The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was first drafted in 1923, three years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote. In 1972, the ERA easily passed Congress with large bipartisan support and seemed headed to full ratification by the states. In this clip, Anne Scott and Karen DeCrow offer their arguments in support of the ERA.
