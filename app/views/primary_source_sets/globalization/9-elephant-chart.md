## Introduction

While most economists argue for the overall benefits of global trade, they acknowledge that those benefits are uneven. Some groups benefit more than others—and indeed, some might not benefit at all. In this piece from the *PBS NewsHour*, economics correspondent Paul Solman introduces viewers to the “Elephant Chart,” a way of measuring historical income trends for people in different parts of the global income distribution. The 2017 segment was aired in the wake of Brexit (the British referendum that separated Britain from the European Union) and the election of Donald Trump. Many political commentators in that moment argued that the rise of right-wing populism was fueled by the frustrations of working and middle classes in wealthier countries who believed they were being hurt by the rise of international trade.
