## Introduction

While President Trump was broadly critical of the impact of global trade on Americans, he was focused particularly on harms of trade with China. In the view of Trump and his advisors, China was not merely undercutting U.S. goods because of low labor costs, but gaining advantage by breaking the rules. They charged that the Chinese government turned a blind eye while their companies stole U.S. companies’ intellectual property, while also manipulating their currency and giving their companies illegal subsidies to make their exports unfairly attractive in foreign markets. The U.S. and China waged a “trade war” during Trump’s first term in which both sides leveled tariffs on the other. By 2020, the two countries agreed to a “Phase One” trade agreement that settled some issues, but many disagreements between the two powers remained unresolved. But Trump’s policies did not just target trade with China. His administration pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a trade deal with many Pacific Rim countries negotiated under the Obama Administration), renegotiated NAFTA, and launched aggressive tariffs on steel and aluminum that affected many countries, including U.S. allies. This PBS NewsHour segment explores Trump’s criticism of China as well as the political ramifications of the steel and aluminum tariffs.
