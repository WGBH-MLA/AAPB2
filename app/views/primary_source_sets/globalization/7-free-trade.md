## Introduction

Critics of free trade policies argued that unfettered global trade hurt workers all over the world: American laborers lost their jobs to workers in developing economies, and in turn, foreign workers were paid meager wages to toil in horrific conditions. But defenders of free trade, like Dan Griswold of the Cato Institute (a libertarian think tank) argued that critics overlooked the benefits of these policies. In this 2004 clip from *Focus 580* (a call-in show from WILL in Urbana, Illinois) Griswold argues that ordinary Americans and workers in developing countries are better off as a result of global trade.
