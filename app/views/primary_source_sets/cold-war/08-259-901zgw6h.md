## Introduction

This video clip is excerpted from _The SALT Syndrome_, a 1979 documentary produced by the American Security Council, a non-profit, bipartisan foundation that promoted “peace through strength.” Televised over 500 times, this short film, which details the strategic arms limitation negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, warned against the United States entering a second strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT II) with the Soviet Union, based on evaluations of the 1972 SALT I treaty. In this clip, government officials criticize and condemn SALT as a diplomatic arrangement that advantaged the Soviet Union.
