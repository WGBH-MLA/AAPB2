## Introduction

In this video clip from _The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour_, David Gergen, editor-at-large of _U.S. News & World Report_, interviews James Baker, former Secretary of State in the George H. W. Bush administration, regarding his last years in government, which overlapped with events commonly associated with the end of the Cold War. In their conversation, Gergen and Baker link those events to Saddam Husseinâ€™s decision to invade Kuwait with Iraqi troops.
