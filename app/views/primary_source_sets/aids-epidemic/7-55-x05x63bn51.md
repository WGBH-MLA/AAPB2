## Introduction

This excerpt from a 1989 special report called *Wrestling with AIDS* from KQED (San Francisco, CA) explores the ethical dilemmas inherent in balancing scientific rigor and immediate humanitarian concerns. Medical trials also provided grounds for controversy during the AIDS crisis. A common practice in drug trials is to randomly assign some participants a new medicine and others a “placebo.” By comparing a “treatment group” to a “control group,” researchers can determine the effectiveness and safety of an experimental drug. However, some PWAs resented being given placebos while they were dying of the disease. Some, like the man interviewed in this segment, subverted the trials by taking experimental drugs after determining they had been given a placebo.
