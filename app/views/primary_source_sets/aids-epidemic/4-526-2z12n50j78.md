## Introduction

The AIDS epidemic coincided with the rise of the “Religious Right,” a group that sought to galvanize conservative voters to restore what leader Jerry Falwell called a “climate of morality” in America. Falwell expressed the beliefs of many in the evangelical conservative movement when he asserted that the AIDS epidemic was the result of gay men “violating the laws of decency and of morality.” This clip, from a 1983 KCTS (Seattle, WA) documentary called *Diagnosis: AIDS*, includes gay activists discussing homophobic responses to the AIDS epidemic, as well as Falwell and fellow cultural conservative Pat Buchanan arguing that contracting AIDS was a result of immoral behavior.
