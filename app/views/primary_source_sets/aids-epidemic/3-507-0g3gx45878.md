## Introduction

As devastating as the health impacts were on PWAs, the financial cost could prove almost as challenging.  Patients often went broke paying thousands of dollars yearly on multiple prescription drugs to treat different aspects of the immune disease.  This piece from *The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour* depicts activists who targeted prescription drug companies for making what they viewed as exorbitant profits on the backs of dying AIDS patients.  The clip also includes a prescription drug company representative defending the industry practice of charging high prices in order to fund the expensive research and development process.
