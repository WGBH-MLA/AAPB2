## Introduction

Frustrated by what it saw as an inadequate and discriminatory political response to the AIDS crisis, ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) arguably became the most prominent AIDS activist organization. As you will see in this *MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour* report, ACT UP became famous for its provocative and theatrical tactics, such as staging “die-ins” in which activists laid down in public places to protest AIDS-related policies or inaction. This clip includes footage of several ACT UP protests and illustrates the group’s sometimes controversial strategy of “screaming, yelling, making a fuss, pissing people off” to “bring about a change.” The report also shows how ACT UP fought vigorously for reforms to the clinical trial process by which experimental drugs were tested for safety and efficacy.
