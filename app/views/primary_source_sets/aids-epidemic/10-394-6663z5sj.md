## Introduction

As the 1980s progressed, intravenous drug abuse became an increasingly common path of HIV transmission when infected users would share needles and spread the disease.  Additionally, once infected, IV drug users could spread the disease through unprotected sex. Thus, a disease that was initially associated with gay men began spreading heavily among heterosexual people of all genders, particularly in poor Black and Latino communities where intravenous drug use was more widespread. By 1990, CDC data showed that the rate of AIDS among Hispanic Americans was three times that of whites, and the rate for African Americans was even higher. These communities of color were the focus of a 1989 Maryland Public Television documentary, *Other Faces of AIDS*. In an effort to combat the spread of HIV, many minority community organizations started youth education initiatives, street outreach programs disseminating condoms, and “harm reduction” programs aimed at IV drug users (such as needle exchange programs).  As the clip shows, such initiatives could meet resistance from critics who felt that these efforts encouraged drug use.
