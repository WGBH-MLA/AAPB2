## Introduction

The AIDS epidemic rose into public consciousness during the Reagan Administration, and the Republican President was notoriously reluctant to address the crisis. This report from *The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour*, published at the end of Reaganâ€™s time in office and during the 1988 presidential campaign, discusses why politicians on both sides of the aisle hesitated to address potentially thorny issues. Additionally, it explores disagreements between the Reagan Administration and medical experts who served on his AIDS commission.
