## Introduction

One vantage point into the human toll of the AIDS crisis can be found in the story of the Turtle Creek Chorale, a gay men’s choral group that lost over 90 members to AIDS.  The documentary *After Goodbye: An AIDS Story* from KERA (Dallas, TX) intersperses personal stories of members who lost friends and loved ones as they sing a special choral piece about the five stages of grief that was written by a choir member who died of AIDS. In this segment, choral members share their experiences of grief, anger, and loss.
