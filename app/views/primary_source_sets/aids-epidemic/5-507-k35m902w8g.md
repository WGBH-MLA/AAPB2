## Introduction

This *MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour* report shows how the AIDS epidemic sometimes spurred reactionary opposition to gay rights. By the early 1980s, the LGBTQ community in Houston had become a potent political force, helping defeat a homophobic mayoral candidate and passing an ordinance banning discrimination in employment. However, as AIDS ravaged the community, gay rights opponents launched a campaign that charged that Houston had “become a hotbed of homosexuality” that “threaten(ed) public health and children” (quotes from this news report). In a 1985 referendum, voters repealed the anti-discrimination ordinance.
