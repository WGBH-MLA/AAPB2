## Introduction

In 1996, Shintech, a Japanese subsidiary, proposed building a $700 million polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant in Convent, Louisiana. Convent is in St. James Parish, in the heart of what the Environmental Defense Fund has identified as one of Americaâ€™s 25 most polluted counties. The population within a four mile radius of the proposed plant site is 84% African American. This Louisiana Public Television video segment shows how the citizens of Convent, assisted by the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, mobilized to keep Shintech out of their community. In 1998, Shintech announced it was abandoning its plans to build a plant in Convent.
