## Introduction

The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 led to the rollback of environmental mandates and reduced funding for the EPA, which ostensibly enforced environmental laws. Greenpeace and other radical environmentalist organizations responded to these developments by embracing civil disobedience. In this New Jersey Nightly News video clip, Greenpeace is protesting the illegal ocean dumping of acid waste into Raritan Bay by NL Industries.
