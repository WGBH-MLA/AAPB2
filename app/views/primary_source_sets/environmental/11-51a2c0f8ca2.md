## Introduction

In 2020, addressing climate change by reducing the number of gas-powered vehicles on    American roads was central to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s platform. Once elected, Biden pushed for passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021), which provided $7.5 billion to build out a national network of 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles (EV’s), $10 billion in clean transportation, and over $7 billion in EV battery components, minerals and materials. This _PBS NewsHour_ story, which aired before the passage of the bill, explores the barriers to EV ownership as well as the targets set by California and U.S automakers to phase out sales and ownership of carbon-emitting vehicles.
