## Introduction

Unlike Greenpeace or other radical environmental groups, the Earth Liberation Front 
(ELF) embraced violence to achieve its goals. The secrecy of the organization and the increasing scale of their attacks led the FBI to label ELF a domestic terrorism threat in 2002. This PBS NewsHour story focuses on the environmental awakening and subsequent radicalization of Daniel McGowan, a former ELF member awaiting trial on charges of arson and conspiracy. The segment also features Steve Swanson, the president of Superior Lumber, a company that ELF targeted for its clear-cutting practices.
