## Introduction

This video clip is from _Our Vanishing Wilderness_, an NET series that aired in 1970. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was the greatest single pollution disaster of its time, washing up an estimated 100,000 barrels of crude oil onto the California coast and killing thousands of birds as well as marine mammals. Media coverage was intense, and public outrage over the costs of offshore drilling helped expand the environmental movement and the push for regulations.
