## Introduction

For a country accustomed to cheap and abundant oil, the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 came as a rude awakening.  By 1973, the United States consumed one-third of all the oil produced in the world despite having less than one-sixth of the worldâ€™s population. Domestic oil production was not sufficient to meet American demand:  imports from Arab nations accounted for 30% of U.S. oil consumption. This arrangement collapsed in the wake of U.S. support for Israel during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) first curtailed production and then imposed an oil embargo against the U.S., leading to shortages, rationing, and skyrocketing gas prices. The energy crisis led President Nixon to call for domestic energy independence and research into alternative sources of energy. The video clip, produced by the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT), notes the lack of a national energy policy and investigates the impact of the fuel shortage on ordinary citizens in Nashua, New Hampshire.
