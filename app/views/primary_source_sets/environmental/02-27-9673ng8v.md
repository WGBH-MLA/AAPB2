## Introduction

David Brower, an American environmentalist who founded Friends of the Earth in 1969, spoke at Antioch College a few weeks before the first Earth Day in 1970. In this audio segment, which aired on WYSO, Brower argues that overpopulation depletes the earthâ€™s resources and identifies the United States as both a primary polluter and consumer of resources. He suggests that all human actions must be considered in terms of what they will cost the earth.
