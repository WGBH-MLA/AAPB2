## Introduction

The partial meltdown of the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979, was the worst commercial nuclear energy plant accident in U.S. history. It forced the evacuation of 100,000 residents, sparked massive public protests, and led many to question whether nuclear power could be a safe source of energy for the United States. Despite the fact that nuclear power plants produce carbon-free energy, as opposed to traditional power plants that produce energy by burning fossil fuels, no nuclear power plants have been built in the U.S. since 1979.  The video clip is from a WETA program about an anti-nuclear demonstration in Washington, D.C. that brought together a broad coalition of citizens opposed to nuclear power plants.
