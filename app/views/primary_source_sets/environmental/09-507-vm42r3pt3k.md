## Introduction

Former Vice President Al Gore reinvented himself as a climate change evangelist after the election of 2000, criss-crossing the country to present his slideshow on the dangers of global warming. The slideshow became a book, which became an award-winning documentary seen by millions of Americans. This _NewsHour with Jim Lehrer_ story features Gore discussing both the scientific research on global warming and his reasons for amplifying what he described as a planetary crisis.
