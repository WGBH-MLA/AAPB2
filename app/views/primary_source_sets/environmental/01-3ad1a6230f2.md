## Introduction

Birdnote aired this audio episode on the 50th anniversary of the publication of _Silent Spring_, Rachel Carson’s 1962 book about the dangers of DDT and other pesticides. The book documented how DDT spraying contaminated the food chain, caused cancer and genetic damage, and decimated entire species of birds. Despite disavowals from the chemical industry, the book prompted congressional hearings after President Kennedy asked his Scientific Advisory Commission to investigate Carson’s findings. While Carson’s argument was dismissed by many in 1962, the segment makes clear that her warnings were prescient. Bird populations rebounded once the United States banned DDT, and the interconnectedness of human activity and the state of the natural world was firmly established.
