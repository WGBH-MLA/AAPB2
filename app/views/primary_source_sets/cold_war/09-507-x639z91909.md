## Introduction

This video clip from The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour covers fast-moving developments in East Germany that occurred as part of a tide of democratic revolutions moving across Soviet satellite nations. These included the decision of the East German Council of Ministers to permit citizens of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) free and unrestricted travel, thus symbolically demolishing the Berlin Wall, and the promise of free elections in East Germany for the first time in 40 years. This clip includes footage of U.S., East German, and other communist officials commenting on the political changes, as well as statements by members of the reform groups behind the change.
