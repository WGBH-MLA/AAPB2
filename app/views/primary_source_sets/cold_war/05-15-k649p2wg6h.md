## Introduction

This video clip from the series War and Peace in the Nuclear Age features footage from the U.S. Air Force film _Cuban Crisis_, which details the U.S. response, under President John F. Kennedy, to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchevâ€™s attempt to install medium and intermediate nuclear missiles on Cuban soil, with the support of Cuban revolutionary and leader Fidel Castro. The footage imparts the perilousness of those circumstances, which many feared would lead to nuclear war and possibly global annihilation.
