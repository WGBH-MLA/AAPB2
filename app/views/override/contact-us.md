We’d love to hear from you. If you have general questions about the website and
collection, or want to share information on the stories you find in the 
collections, please send an email to info@americanarchive.org.

Feel free to email project staff with specific questions. WGBH’s focus is 
access, outreach, and description of materials, while Library of Congress may be
contacted about preservation strategies.
