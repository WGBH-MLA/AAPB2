### 6. Participating Organizations Communication Toolkit

The AAPB Participating Organizations Communications Kit provides guidance for spreading the word about how your community can access your historic programming that is preserved in the AAPB. Let your local community know about your archival content, and where they can access it online! Access the toolkit: http://americanarchive.org/help/station-communications-toolkit.

### 7. Transcripts

With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the AAPB has created computer-generated transcripts for every item in the AAPB. Contact Casey for more details.

We often get requests from producers seeking to license content they found in the AAPB. We refer them back to the contributing organization, and we can also provide licensing information on your records and organization page. Feel free to send us some language and contact details, and we can update it on the website. Contact Casey for more information.
