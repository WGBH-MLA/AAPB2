## Resources for AAPB Participating Organizations

### 1. Preservation Consultations

Do you have specific questions on how to proceed with your preservation efforts? AAPB’s Project Manager is just an email or phone call away! Contact Casey Davis Kaufman at [Casey_Davis-Kaufman@wgbh.org](mailto:casey_davis-kaufman@wgbh.org).

### 2. Archival Management System (AMS)

Participating organizations have exclusive access to the Archival Management System (AMS), where you can search and access your metadata, export records, watch/listen to your digital files, and download low-res files at [ams.americanarchive.org](http://ams.americanarchive.org). Contact Ryn Marchese, AAPB's Engagement and Use Manager, to update or add your organization users at [Ryn_Marchese@wgbh.org](mailto:ryn_marchese@wgbh.org).

### 3. Customize Your Organization Page on the AAPB Website

Each organization has a landing page on AAPB’s website, and we encourage adding a logo and org summary to provide more background on your programs! Find your page: http://americanarchive.org/participating-orgs Please forward any updates to Ryn.

### 4. Grant Writing Assistance

Are you interested in applying for a digitization grant? Let’s collaborate! We can point you to a few grant programs and provide you with our digitization grant writing toolkit of materials that you can incorporate into your proposal. Contact Casey, AAPB’s Project Manager, for details.

### 5. AAPB's Preservation Wiki

For preservation resources and workflows used for managing audiovisual assets in all their possible formats and environments, check out our wiki at [wiki.americanarchive.org](http://wiki.americanarchive.org).

### 6. Participating Organizations Communication Toolkit

The AAPB Participating Organizations Communications Kit provides guidance for spreading the word about how your community can access your historic programming that is preserved in the AAPB. Let your local community know about your archival content, and where they can access it online! Access the toolkit: http://americanarchive.org/help/station-communications-toolkit.

### 7. Transcripts

With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the AAPB has created computer-generated transcripts for every item in the AAPB. Contact Ryn for more details.

### 8. Free Digitization Opportunity through 2019!

The Transcribe to Digitize Challenge is a year-long opportunity hosted by the digitization service provider George Blood, LP. The challenge is simple: if your organization can correct between 20-100 of the computer-generated transcripts for your content via AAPB’s crowdsourcing platform [FIX IT+](http://fixitplus.americanarchive.org), George Blood will digitize an equivalent number of your tapes for free. Contact Ryn for details.

### 9. Referring Licensing Inquiries

We often get requests from producers seeking to license content they found in the AAPB. We refer them back to the contributing organization, and we can also provide licensing information on your records and organization page. Feel free to send us some language and contact details, and we can update it on the website. Contact Ryn for more information.

### 10. Connect with us!
