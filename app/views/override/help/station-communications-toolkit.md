# Participating Organizations Communications Kit

The AAPB Participating Organizations Communications Kit provides guidance for spreading the word about your involvement in the AAPB and how your community can access the historic programming being preserved in the archive from your organization.

If you have any questions, please contact Ryn Marchese, AAPB Engagement and Use Manager at [ryn_marchese@wgbh.org](mailto:ryn_marchese@wgbh.org).

We encourage sharing and promoting your organization’s contributions in the archive in the following ways:

### AAPB boilerplate language:

Please use AAPB’s boilerplate language when describing the AAPB:

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) is a collaboration between the Library of Congress and the WGBH Educational Foundation to coordinate a national effort to preserve at-risk public media before its content is lost to posterity and provide a central web portal for access to the unique programming that public stations have aired over the past 60+ years. To date, over 50,000 hours of television and radio programming contributed by more than 100 public media organizations and archives across the United States have been digitized for long-term preservation and access. The entire collection is available on location at WGBH and the Library of Congress, and more than 30,000 programs are available online at [americanarchive.org](http://americanarchive.org).
