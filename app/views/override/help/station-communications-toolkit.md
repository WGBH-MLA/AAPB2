# Publicity Tips and Guidelines for Participating Organizations

Thank you for participating in the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) and for your support of public media’s long-term preservation and access. These guidelines help provide a template for spreading the word about your contribution to the AAPB and how your community can access historic programming from your organization.

If you have any questions, please contact Casey Davis Kaufman, AAPB Project Manager at [casey_davis-kaufman@wgbh.org](mailto:casey_davis-kaufman@wgbh.org).

### Promoting your organization:

We encourage sharing and promoting your organization’s contributions in the archive in the following ways:

- Dedicate a page on your website about your history and participation in the AAPB, emphasizing that it will be preserved for future generations to enjoy, and include a link to your organization’s historic content that can be accessed in AAPB. Find your landing page [here](http://americanarchive.org/participating-orgs).

>Example social post: “We have preserved our local history with the <a href="https://twitter.com/amarchivepub">@amarchivepub</a>! Visit our collection online at https://americanarchive.org/participating-orgs/1784.2."

- Issue a press release: To issue an announcement to your local media, reach out to GBH External Communications Manager Emily Balk (emily_balk@wgbh.org) for a template press release and work with your communications team to reach reporters in your area.

- Write a blog post about your historic content, with links to your organization’s page or specific digitized programs in the AAPB.

>Check out this [blog post](https://www.thirteen.org/blog-post/historic-black-journal-streams-for-the-first-time/) from WNET. KYUK in Bethel, Alaska also shared a great [article](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2017/10/11/worlds-largest-collection-of-yupik-and-cupik-videos-now-available-online/) about their participation in the AAPB.

- Include information about your AAPB participation in print materials, anniversary booklets, newsletters, etc.

- Share your historic content and blog post on social media, using clips and/or stills from the programs, if rights allow. Make sure to link to the full programs available on the AAPB website and tag <a href="https://twitter.com/amarchivepub">@amarchivepub</a>.

>Example social post: “#OTD in 1956, Autherine Lucy is the first Black student to attend the University of Alabama. In 1955, lawyer Arthur Shores had defended Lucy's right to attend the university, but in 1956, riots broke out and Lucy was expelled.

- If an opportunity exists, go on-the-air at your station to talk about your station’s history and the archival programming preserved and made available in the AAPB.

In any of these situations, we’d be happy to provide you with low-res copies of specific items from your organization that you wish to promote; we just ask that you notify us a few days in advance of your deadline.
