# Submit New and Revised Metadata to the AAPB

Organizations already participating in the AAPB may submit updated and/or new inventory records. 

In light of its mission to coordinate a national effort to preserve public media, the AAPB team encourages all organizations that hold public media materials in their collections to consider contributing metadata records to the AAPB catalog. Centralizing metadata records in one national catalog will increase discoverability for researchers and help collection managers make informed preservation decisions.
