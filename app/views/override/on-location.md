The Library of Congress Motion Picture and Recorded Sound Division contains two sections, Recorded Sound and Moving Image. These two sections have distinct policies and procedures regarding on-site access. 

### Recorded Sound Section
Hours and Location:<br/>
8:30 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday<br/>
Library of Congress<br/>
101 Independence Ave. SE<br/>
James Madison Building, LM 113<br/>
Recorded Sound Research Center<br/>
Performing Arts Reading Room<br/>
Washington, DC 20540-4690<br/>

#### Who Can Listen:

Recorded Sound collections are available to the public for listening in the Recorded Sound Research Center. Listening facilities are provided without charge. 

#### Listening Appointments:
Recordings that fall under the rubric of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting Collection will be available for listening on demand, on-site at the Library.

Appointments are required for listening to most of the other material in the Library’s collections. Recordings do not circulate. Listeners can telephone the Research Center at (202) 707-7833, fax requests to (202) 707-8464, or submit an email request to rsrc@loc.gov. 

The Library holds public media material other than the American Archive of Public Broadcasting Collection; these materials, if not already digitized, will take at least two weeks for engineers to digitize for listening appointments. Special arrangements are required for requests of more than five items needing digitization at one time. Certain audio formats will require more time to digitize and will necessitate a longer wait. Please contact the Research Center as soon as possible with large requests or to identify previously digitized recordings.

Patrons may use the Research Center without appointment to access catalogs, in-house databases, reference books, archival manuscript collections, microfiche, microfilm, and other reference sources.

Submitting Listening Requests:
For listening requests of materials other than those in the American Archive Collection, be sure to include the name and title of the items requested, the call numbers (e.g., RWD 3214; LWO 5599 gr12 r2a1-3b), and your personal contact information so that we can confirm your appointment. 

Offsite researchers may begin their search by using the [Recorded Sound Research Center site](http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/), Library of Congress Online Catalog, or Sound Online Inventory and Catalog (SONIC). If unable to find a recording in the catalogs, please contact our reference staff by emailing rsrc@loc.gov or calling (202) 707-7833. 

### Moving Image Section
Hours and Location:<br/>
8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday<br/>
Library of Congress<br/>
101 Independence Ave. SE<br/>
James Madison Building, LM 336<br/>
Moving Image Research Center<br/>
Washington, D.C. 20540-4690<br/>

#### Who Can View:
Digital access copies of American Archive of Public Broadcasting Collection materials are available to the public for screening in the Moving Image Research Center.

For materials in Library moving image collections other than those in the American Archive Collection, film, video, and digital access copies are available for screening by qualified researchers.  Viewing facilities are provided without charge for individuals doing research that will lead to publicly available works, such as dissertations, publications, or film/television productions.  University students with projects endorsed by their professors also qualify. We are unable to accommodate groups.

#### Viewing Appointments:

Advance notice is not needed for viewing items that have been digitized, but a reservation is recommended to guarantee equipment availability.  If an appointment needs to be cancelled or rescheduled, please contact the reference staff as soon as possible.  Cancellation without sufficient notice can prevent others from having access to the facilities.

#### Submitting Viewing Requests:
When submitting viewing requests for materials other than those in the American Archive collection, please provide title, call number (e.g. VBG 3214; FCA 4414-4416), and date.

Offsite researchers should begin their search by using the [Moving Image Research Center site](http://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/) or Library of Congress Online Catalog.  For materials other than those in the American Archive Collection, please limit your request to forty titles.  

The Library holds public media material other than the American Archive of Public Broadcasting Collection. When an access copy does not exist for public media that is not in the American Archive Collection, researchers can contact a reference librarian to discuss the possibility of generating a digital access copy.

### For Recorded Sound and Moving Image Sections

Recording equipment of any type is not allowed in the Research Centers. Photographing images from the screen for reference purposes will be permitted only when authorized in advance by our reference staff.
