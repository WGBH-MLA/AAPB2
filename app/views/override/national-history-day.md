Each year, National History Day frames students’ research within a historical theme. The 2020-2021 theme is Communication in History: The Key to Understanding. National History Day (NHD) and students are exploring topics related to the ways that people have exchanged information throughout the past, how these methods and modes have changed over time, and how they have affected life today. 
Public broadcasting has been an influential form of communication for the past seven decades, and students can use the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) to explore how public media has communicated important issues to the American public through television and radio. More than 55,000 programs from the late 1930s to the present day are streaming online, including interviews with leading political and cultural figures and ordinary people, national newscasts and news from diverse communities across the nation, revealing documentaries, and live coverage of events as they occurred.
