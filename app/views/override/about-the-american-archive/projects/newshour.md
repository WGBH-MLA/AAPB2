# PBS NewsHour Digitization Project

The PBS NewsHour Digitization Project, funded by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), is an unprecedented 
effort in collaboration between WGBH, the Library of Congress, Washington Educational Television Association (WETA), and NewsHour 
Productions, LLC. This project will digitize, preserve, and allow public access to 32 years of *PBS NewsHour*â€™s predecessor programs, 
including *The Robert MacNeil Report*, *The MacNeil/Lehrer Report*, *The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour*, and *The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer*. 
Broadcast programs (from 1975 through December 2007) will be digitized that chronicle American and world history, providing scholars 
access to original source material, including interviews with presidents and other world leaders and reports on major issues and events. 
More than 9,000 existing transcripts for the entire 40 years of programs (1975-present) also will be made available. As part of the 
AAPB, scholars will be able to compare and study the differences between national news and local news from public media stations across 
the country.
