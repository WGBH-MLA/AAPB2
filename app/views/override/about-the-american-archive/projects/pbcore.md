# PBCore Development and Training Project

![banner](/page-banners/banner4.jpg)

In 2016, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awarded WGBH a Preservation and Access Research and Development 
grant to pursue the PBCore Development and Training Project. Short for “Public Broadcasting Metadata Dictionary,” 
[PBCore](http://pbcore.org) is a metadata schema – a standard for organizing information – for the management of 
public media and audiovisual collections in the United States.

WGBH will use the grant funds to develop tools, methodologies and training workshops to make PBCore more 
accessible to archivists and public media organizations over the course of this 27-month project. 

WGBH’s Media Library and Archives (MLA) has been responsible for the ongoing development of PBCore since 2013, when 
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) selected WGBH and the Library of Congress as the permanent stewards 
of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB). 

The grant award will fund a number of initiatives designed to enhance PBCore’s accessibility among archivists, 
public media organizations, and archival educators. Deliverables for the project will include:

- a new widely available open-source PBCore cataloging tool
- improvements and updates to existing PBCore tools
- metadata crosswalks and sample integrations with a number of commonly-used metadata standards
- updated PBCore-based Excel templates, sample records, and use cases that expand upon existing guidelines and 
put them in plain language for non-archivists
- updates to the PBCore website that incorporate the new tools and documentation in an accessible and user-friendly manner
- a set of free webinars explaining the use of the new tools
- a printable PDF manual collecting all PBCore documentation and cataloging guidelines
- PBCore user training workshops held at major conferences
- two fully-funded PBCore train-the-trainer workshops which will fund public media professionals and archival 
educators to learn about training others in PBCore
