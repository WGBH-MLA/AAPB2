The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program has provided funding for WGBH, on behalf of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), to develop a [National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR)](http://ndsr.americanarchive.org/) project to train residents and develop curriculum for an increasingly critical area of digital preservation, the preservation of audiovisual materials. The Library of Congress, in partnership with IMLS, originally piloted the NDSR program as a post-graduate digital stewardship residency program. WGBH participated as a host institution in the second round of NDSR residencies, also funded by IMLS, which was managed by Harvard University and MIT. The AAPB NDSR project will place seven residents at diverse geographic public television and radio organizations across the country and thus expand the locally based NDSR model to a national level. The project will also provide important information and lay the groundwork for a virtual national NDSR fellowship program.
