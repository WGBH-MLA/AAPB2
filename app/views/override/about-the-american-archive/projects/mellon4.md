<h2>The AAPB is now accepting submissions for the Fall/Winter 2023-24 cycle. We plan to allocate an average of 1,500 - 2,000 items per organization. We aim to digitize approximately 30,000 items by February 2024. Submit your collection by November 30, 2023 to be part of this cycle!

<h3>About the Project</h3>
 
The Mellon Foundation has awarded GBH a large grant to support the American Archive of Public Broadcasting’s work to digitally preserve and improve access to historically significant public media. Specifically, the grant supports the digitization and inclusion in the AAPB of programming and materials that are at risk of deterioration and represent the diversity of American voices. The project will double the size of the AAPB, making more public media content available to researchers, academics and the American public than ever before.  (You can read more about the Mellon grant here.)
 
GBH invites stations, producers, and archives to nominate materials in their collections for preservation and inclusion in the AAPB. Digitization and shipping are fully funded by the grant, and submitters will receive their own digital copies of their materials. If potential submitters need assistance with preparing their collections for digitization, let us know and we may be able to help.

<h3>Weekly Office Hours</h3>

For general questions about the grant, your organization’s involvement, or the steps involved to participate, you are welcome to join our weekly office hours with AAPB Media Historian and Curator Michelle Kelley. Office hours take place every Wednesday at 12:00 pm ET. Please join using this Zoom link: https://wgbh.zoom.us/j/91720091309?pwd=QWlDSEJQUEVLRHh1VGtZSjA0U1hHdz09

On the last Wednesday of every month, Rachel Curtis, Digital Conversion Specialist with the Library of Congress, will join the office hours to address technical questions concerning formats, inventorying, and the preservation process.

<h3>Details Regarding Participation</h3> 

In order to streamline the process and maximize the funds for digitizing, the AAPB team has developed the following criteria for submission requests.  The submitter of materials will need to:

1) Submit a general description of materials including:
- summary of content (including, if available, series titles, themes, topics)
- broadcast date range
- types of programming (news and public affairs, cultural, talk shows, full interviews, promos, b-roll, etc.)
- estimated number of items
- formats
- general condition of the tapes (e.g., Does it have mold? Are the cases intact? Is there a strange smell? Have they been stored in a non-climate-controlled space?)
- any known information about the copyright status of the material
- any additional information you wish to provide about the significance of the collection
 
You can submit your general description of materials to **aapb_submissions@wgbh.org**.

AAPB will review the description provided and will decide whether to move forward with the collection, in whole or in part.
 
2) Submitters should understand that in order for their collection to become part of AAPB, they must sign an AAPB Deed of Gift. A template is available here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/resources/AAPB_model-deed-of-gift.docx 
  
3) If selected, you will be invited to submit a full inventory of tapes proposed to be digitized.
-an inventory is a spreadsheet with each item having 1 row and includes format, title or identifying label, unique identifier, and date if known. If submitters cannot provide inventory on their own, let us know, and we may be able to help.
- AAPB must approve the inventory for digitization before the items are shipped.

4) Submitters will be asked to box and ship tapes to the digitization vendor. Submitters will need to purchase boxes  and pallets if necessary. The grant will pay for shipping.

5) Once tapes are digitized, the vendor will send submitters their desired combination of preservation,  mezzanine, and low-res access files.
- submitters must return vendor hard drives or purchase them from the vendor. Submitters must indicate upon arrival of tapes at the vendor if they plan to purchase the hard drives.
- submitters have 30 days to QC files and report any issues with the files.
- vendor will return tapes to submitters after the 30-day window.
- AAPB advises that the submitters keep tapes at least until LOC has reviewed the files and ingested into collection.
