## Library and Education Collaborators 

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) collaborates with educational and cultural organizations across the nation, as well as libraries and archives to share in the effort of providing access to historic records. The AAPB is pleased to collaborate with the following organizations:

### Digital Public Library of America
![DLPA Logo Image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/DPLA_logo.png) The [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la) amplifies the value of libraries and cultural organizations as Americans’ most trusted sources of shared knowledge. The AAPB has made items searchable in the DPLA, and you can find historic items from the AAPB in their primary source sets.

### National History Day 
![NHD Logo Image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/NHD_logo.png) [National History Day](https://www.nhd.org) offers a year-long national research competition that engages over half a million middle and high school students around the world annually in conducting original research on historical topics of interest. Visit the [AAPB National History Day](https://americanarchive.org/national-history-day) page for more information on the NHD theme for 2020-2021, ‘Communication in History: The Key to Understanding’.

### National Humanities Center
![NHC Logo Image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/NHC_logo.png) The AAPB is contributing resources to the [Humanities in Class Digital Library](https://education.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/login?next=%2F), an online portal provided by the [National Humanities Center](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/). The portal provides access to instructional resources and scholarly materials in support of humanities education. Resources are tagged by subject matter, topics, and material type, making it easy to discover and combine openly available content for educators.

### PBS Learning Media
[PBS LearningMedia](https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/) provides educational resources produced by public media and targeted specifically for educators. High-quality content is tied to Common Core and national curriculum standards and is freely available to all educators as a basic service. The AAPB and PBSLM are working together to match resources in PBSLM with full-length and related archival programs and original materials made available in the AAPB Online Reading Room. 

### Share My Lesson
![SML Logo Image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/SML_logo.png) The award-winning [Share My Lesson](https://sharemylesson.com/partner/american-archive-public-broadcasting) platform was created by the American Federation of Teachers and The Times Educational Supplement (TES) Global in 2012. Share My Lesson provides high-quality and effective lesson plans and professional development resources. The AAPB staff has provided downloadable resources and an informational webinar on using primary sources for distance learning.
