### New Collections
The AAPB recently acquired three collections of original, full-length interviews from groundbreaking public television documentaries: Ken Burns’ *The Civil War*, *Eyes on the Prize* and *American Masters*. Only excerpts of these interviews were included in previously released, edited programs. Now, the full-length interviews from these landmark series will be available to view online at americanarchive.org or in person at the Library of Congress and at WGBH, preserved for future generations to learn about our nation’s history.

#### Interviews from Ken Burns' *The Civil War*
![Ken Burns' The Civil War](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/special-collections/civil-war_small.jpeg "Ken Burns' The Civil War")*The Civil War*, an epic nine-episode series by the award-winning documentary filmmaker Ken Burns and produced in conjunction with WETA, Washington, DC and American Documentaries, Inc., first aired in September 1990 to an audience of 40 million viewers. The film is the recipient of 40 major film and television awards, including two Emmys and two Grammys.

The AAPB *The Civil War* interviews collection includes eight digitized, full-length interviews with distinguished historians and commentators Barbara J. Fields, C. Vann Woodward, Robert Penn Warren, William Safire, James Symington, Stephen B.

#### Interviews from *Eyes on the Prize*
![Eyes on the Prize](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/special-collections/eotp_small.jpeg "Eyes on the Prize")*Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954–1965* tells the definitive story of the civil rights era from the point of view of the ordinary men and women whose extraordinary actions launched a movement that changed the fabric of American life, and embodied a struggle whose reverberations continue to be felt today. The award-winning documentary series recounts the fight to end decades of discrimination and segregation from the murder of Emmett Till and the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and 1956 to the 1965 Voting Rights Campaign in Selma, Alabama. Eyes on the Prize was produced by Blackside, Inc. and aired on PBS in 1987.

The *Eyes on the Prize* interviews collection comes from Washington University Libraries’ Henry Hampton Collection and includes 75 hours of full-length interviews with leaders and activists such as Rosa Parks, Constance Baker Motley, James Farmer, Robert Moses, Andrew Young, John Lewis, Ralph Abernathy, Stokely Carmichael and Myrlie Evers. The Eyes on the Prize collection is available online at [americanarchive.org/special_collections/eotp-i-interviews](/special_collections/eotp-i-interviews).

#### Interviews from *American Masters*
![American Masters](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/special-collections/american-masters_small.jpeg "American Masters")*American Masters*, produced by New York public television station THIRTEEN/WNET, is an award-winning biography series that celebrates arts and culture. Launched in 1986, the series has set the standard for documentary film profiles.

AAPB has preserved more than 800 full-length interviews filmed by *American Masters* with artists and leaders such as David Bowie, Yoko Ono, Robert Plant, Tim Burton, Nora Ephron, Denzel Washington, Carol Burnett, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Quincy Jones and Jimmy Carter. The interviews, digitized for In Their Own Words: The *American Masters* Digital Archive and the *American Masters* Podcast, will be archived for long-term storage at the Library of Congress to ensure their survival for future generations. Researchers can access the full collection only on location at the Library of Congress and WGBH. Information about the *American Masters* collection is available at [americanarchive.org/special_collections/american-masters-interviews](/special_collections/american-masters-interviews).

AAPB has launched a new exhibit titled “Gavel-to-Gavel”: The Watergate Scandal and Public Television. Curated by Library of Congress Junior Fellow Amanda Reichenbach, the exhibit provides, for the first time, complete online access to video coverage of the 51 days of the Senate Watergate hearings and 7 days of the House Impeachment hearings, recorded by the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) with commentary by Robert MacNeil, Jim Lehrer, and Paul Duke. The exhibit includes essays on the Watergate Scandal, the subsequent Senate Watergate hearings and House Impeachment hearings, a Cast of Characters page to help identify people in the videos, an essay on the significant role that Watergate played in the history of Public Broadcasting, and a page providing information about other resources.

### Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship
In September 2017, WGBH on behalf of the AAPB was awarded a grant by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to fund the Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship. The project supports students enrolled in non-specialized graduate programs to pursue digital preservation projects at public broadcasting organizations around the country. The Fellowship is designed to provide graduate students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experiences in the practices of audiovisual preservation; address the need for digitization of at-risk public media materials in underserved areas; and increase audiovisual preservation education capacity in Library and Information Science graduate programs around the country. More information is available at our PBPF project website [pbpf.americanarchive.org](http://pbpf.americanarchive.org).
