What’s New Page

## March 2018

### New Exhibit 

Curated by AAPB Digital Exhibits Intern Kara Zelasko, “Protecting Places: Historic Preservation and Public Broadcasting” uses a diverse range of public radio and television content from 1950 – 2012 to highlight how people have used public broadcasting to advocate, negotiate, or protest historic preservation efforts across America.  More than 100 digitized, historic public broadcasting programs, local news reports, radio call-in shows, and interviews document the important relationship historic structures have fostered between people and their neighborhoods. These visual and audio records, digitized and preserved by the AAPB, reveal the ways people have used or rejected preservation in the ever-changing American landscape to share local and national histories, illuminating the ways Americans have envisioned their communities through buildings and sites that connect past to present. “Protecting Places: Historic Preservation and Public Broadcasting” is available online at [http://americanarchive.org/exhibits/historic-preservation](/exhibits/historic-preservation).

The NAEB collection includes radio documentaries, coverage of events (hearings, meetings, conferences, and seminars), interviews, debates, and lectures on public affairs topics such as civil rights, foreign affairs, health, politics, education, and broadcasting. Interview subjects and/or program participants feature public figures including Hubert Humphrey, Betty Shabazz, Robert Frost, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alistair Cooke, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Margaret Mead, Studs Terkel, Dr. Albert Schweitzer, Marshall McLuhan, and Aldous Huxley.

### New Grant Project
#### Public Radio as a Tool for Cultural Engagement in New York in the 60s and early 70s: Digitizing the Broadcasts of WRVR-FM Public Radio
![Riverside Church](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/special-collections/RiverSide.jpeg "Riverside Logo")
The Council on Library and Information Resources has awarded a grant to The Riverside Church in the City of New York and the American Archive of Public Broadcasting to digitize, preserve, and make publicly accessible previously unavailable archives of the Peabody Award winning radio station WRVR. The collection includes culturally significant non-commercial programming, including interviews, speeches, and musical interpretations on matters such as civil rights, war, and fine arts, from laypersons to famed scholars, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Pete Seeger.

Preservation of WRVR materials will enhance study in many disciplines, including theology/religion, political science, and communications, especially related to American Christianity, homiletics, progressive responses to the Civil Rights movement, contemporary issues of race and sexuality, the cultural impact of the 1960s, and public radio as a tool for cultural engagement and social media precursor.

### ROLL THE CREDITS: Classifying and Transcribing Text with Zooniverse
In December 2017, the American Archive of Public Broadcasting launched ROLL THE CREDITS, a new Zooniverse project to engage the public in helping catalog credits for digitized public television programs in the AAPB. Volunteers are helping the AAPB by classifying and transcribing the text from extracted frames of uncataloged public television programs, providing the AAPB with information that can be plugged directly into the catalog for improved search and discovery. Access ROLL THE CREDITS at [zooniverse.org/projects/sroosa/roll-the-credits]( https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sroosa/roll-the-credits)

Eyes on the Prize was produced by Blackside, Inc. and aired on PBS in 1987.

### Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship
In September 2017, WGBH on behalf of the AAPB was awarded a grant by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to fund the Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship. The project supports students enrolled in non-specialized graduate programs to pursue digital preservation projects at public broadcasting organizations around the country. The Fellowship is designed to provide graduate students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experiences in the practices of audiovisual preservation; address the need for digitization of at-risk public media materials in underserved areas; and increase audiovisual preservation education capacity in Library and Information Science graduate programs around the country. More information is available at our PBPF project website [pbpf.americanarchive.org](http://pbpf.americanarchive.org).
