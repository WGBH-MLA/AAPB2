## AAPB Vision Statement

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting seeks to preserve and make accessible significant historical content created by public media, and to coordinate a national effort to save at-risk public media before its content is lost to posterity.

## AAPB Mission Statement

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting seeks to:

- Become a focal point for discoverability of historical public media content;

- Coordinate a national effort to preserve and make accessible as much 
significant public broadcasting materials as possible;

- Encourage coordinated participation by providing content creators in the 
public media system with standards and best practices, guidance, training, and 
advice for storing, processing, preserving, and making accessible their 
historical content, and for raising funds in order to accomplish these tasks;

- Disseminate content widely by facilitating the use of archival public media 
content by scholars, educators, students, journalists, media producers, 
researchers, and the public, for the purpose of learning, informing, and 
teaching;

- Increase public awareness of the significance of historical public media and 
the need to preserve and make accessible significant public broadcasting 
programs; and

- Ensure the perpetuation of the archive by working toward financial 
sustainability.
