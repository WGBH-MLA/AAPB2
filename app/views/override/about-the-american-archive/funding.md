The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) promotes the growth and development of public media in communities throughout America. CPB provided funding for the American Archive Pilot Project, the American Archive Content Inventory Project, and the American Archive Digitization Project. Upon selecting WGBH and the Library of Congress as the permanent stewards of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, CPB awarded these organizations a two-year grant to complete the digitization project, accession and ingest the AAPB collection into the Library's systems, develop a website for public access, and develop policies for sustaining the initiative and growing the collection.

## Council on Library and Information Resources

The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) awarded WGBH in collaboration with the Library of Congress a Cataloging Hidden Special Collections and Archives grant to lead the National Educational Television (NET) Collection Catalog Project, the first project to build upon the American Archive of Public Broadcasting initiative. This project will involve the creation of a national catalog of records to provide robust descriptions of programs distributed by NET (1952-1972), comprising the earliest public television content.
