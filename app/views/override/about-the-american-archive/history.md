Digital technology not only offers a means for creating a universally
acceptable archive but also allows the materials to be repurposed in a thousand
different ways for educational and journalistic purposes.

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between WGBH
Educational Foundation and the Library of Congress, was instituted in 2013 to
coordinate a national effort to identify, preserve, and make accessible as much
as possible the historical record of publicly funded broadcasting in the U.S.
While the need for a public broadcasting archival initiative was recognized
nearly fifty years ago, efforts and funding to methodically implement a
nationally coordinated program did not begin in earnest until the advent of the
digital age in the 21st century.

##20th Century – A Proposed “Library and Archives of Noncommercial Educational Television or Radio Programs”

The earliest conception of an archive of public media can be traced back to the
Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting (CPB) and mandated it “to establish and maintain a library and
archives of noncommercial educational television or radio programs and related
materials.”[<sup>2</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#2)  A decade
later, however, an internal Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) report concluded
that after 24 years of noncommercial television, “there is no program archive
or aural-visual history of public television in the United States…. There is no
full-time staff member at any national public broadcasting organization who
devotes his time exclusively to archive planning -- let alone
implementation.”[<sup>3</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#3)  The
report held out hope that with the recent passage of the American Television
and Radio Archives (ATRA) legislation as part of the Copyright Act of 1976, the
Library of Congress would develop a comprehensive plan “to preserve the
nation’s radio and television history, both commercial and
non-commercial.”[<sup>4</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#4)  ATRA
called on the Library to establish such an archive in order “to preserve a
permanent record of the television and radio programs which are the heritage of
the people of the United States and to provide access to such programs to
historians and scholars without encouraging or causing copyright
infringement.”[<sup>5</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#5)

After ATRA’s passage, PBS donated preprint elements for some 10,000 programs to
the Library.[<sup>6</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#6)  PBS also
established its own Public Television Library and Broadcast Archive in 1979,
but the archive ceased operations in 1983 in response to a lowered budget
forecast.[<sup>7</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#7)  Ten years
later, PBS and the Library of Congress entered into an agreement consistent
with ATRA for the transfer of the “best copy” of “all PBS programs that have
been or will be broadcast ... for which PBS has not held distribution rights
for at least 12 months, as well as related cataloging materials in hard and
machine copy form.”[<sup>8</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#8)
Similarly, in 1976 the Library entered into the first of a series of agreements
with National Public Radio (NPR) to acquire, preserve, and provide researcher
access to NPR arts, cultural, and performance program tapes dating from 1971,
the year that NPR began operations, to 1991. NPR news and public affairs
program tapes dating from 1971 to 1988 were stored at the National
Archives.[<sup>9</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#9)

Two additional public broadcasting archival initiatives of importance coincided
with these efforts. In 1979, the first public broadcasting station archive was
founded at WGBH, which “established a formal records management and archives
program staffed by fulltime professional archivists,” a program that remained
unique among public broadcasting stations in its professionalism for many
years.[<sup>10</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#10)

Second, the National Public Broadcasting Archives (NPBA) at the University of
Maryland was established in June 1990, with a concentration in its early years
on preserving documents pertaining to public broadcasting entities, including
the textual records of CPB, PBS, and NPR. Beginning in 1993, NPBA began to
acquire moving image and audio materials as well as paper documents from
selected institutions, including WETA, PBS, Maryland Public Television, and the
Agency for Instructional
Technology.[<sup>11</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#11)  NPBA’s
curator, however, qualified the scope of the organization’s archival efforts
that its name might seem to imply, stating, “While it is impossible to serve as
a national central repository for all public television and radio stations, it
is within NPBA’s mission to advise and assist stations in establishing archives
or work out archival service agreements between stations and local universities
or historical
societies.”[<sup>12</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#12)

Aware that a “cohesive, nationwide effort to safeguard and preserve American
television and video” was needed due to “the impermanence of videotape with all
its formats, the massive volume of generated material, and the decentralized
and fragmentary nature of production processes in the United States compared to
those of other countries,” the Library of Congress in 1994 called for “a
national study on the state of American television and video materials” and the
“development of a national television and video preservation plan,” promising
to seek congressional authorization and funding under the framework of ATRA to
undertake these
initiatives.[<sup>13</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#13)  The
resultant study, Television and Video Preservation 1997, included a section on
public television that began

>
Despite historically small audiences, public television has been responsible
for the production, broadcast, and dissemination of some of the most important
programs which in [the] aggregate form the richest audiovisual source of
cultural history in the United States. In an age where the multiplicity of
cable television program outlets has shifted the paradigm to
noncommercial/public television, it is still not easy to overstate the immense
cultural value of this unique audiovisual legacy, whose loss would symbolize
one of the great conflagrations of our age, tantamount to the burning of
Alexandria’s library in the age of antiquity.

In contrast to this elevated prose, the study revealed that practically,
“neither PBS nor the Library is in a position to accept or prepare all the
materials for transfer” according to the terms of their 1993 agreement. “PBS
needs assistance to inventory and prepare the balance of materials for
transfer,” the study pointed out, and the Library “requires additional storage
space and processing staff to handle
them.”[<sup>14</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#14)  Similarly, a
representative from a leading public broadcasting station spoke for many in the
archival and public broadcasting community when he lamented that “having
created a unique video record of American arts, ideas, history, nature and
sciences, public television is far too financially vulnerable to salvage what
it has created.”[<sup>15</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#15)

Despite these apprehensions, the study maintained an optimistic attitude. PBS,
it noted, stored the master materials that had not been transferred to the
Library in a climate controlled facility.  Descriptive information about
individual programs was not publicly accessible, however, and “no single
centralized inventory or descriptive database system”
existed.[<sup>16</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#16)

In addition to surveying nationally produced and distributed public
broadcasting preservation efforts, the study addressed the state of local
programming preservation practices as well. “There are many affiliate
productions that were never broadcast on PBS,” the study stated, recommending
that the system’s 345 affiliates should “identify their own indigenous programs
and make them a priority for preservation.” The NPBA curator noted that “a lot
of moving image material out there is collected in historical societies and
stations ... under environment conditions that are less than
optimal.”[<sup>17</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#17)  Even WGBH,
public broadcasting’s most professional station archive, lacked proper
facilities to store color film – which made up 85% of its film collection – for
the long term.[<sup>18</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#18)

The study offered a plan for the future that prioritized coordination to help
stations and archives make informed preservation decisions, more funding for
preservation, and increased professionalism:

>
Probably the greatest need to shore up the preservation activities of public
broadcasting is simply coordination, which can be brought about by the sharing
of information.…

>
The creation and sharing of comprehensive inventory databases seem essential
for achieving any real success in coordinating the efforts of affiliates….

>
Since the Library of Congress has assumed responsibility for storing,
processing, re-formatting and servicing all past, present, and future PBS
transmissions, the Library will ultimately require additional funding which
should come from CPB….

>
Affiliates that are part of state or municipal entities should seek local or
regional funding for preservation activities ….

>
Affiliates should take a close look at the WGBH Media Archives and Preservation
Center as a model for some of the larger producers of programming
material.[<sup>19</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#19)

At the end of the 20th century, scattered initiatives by professional
archivists to preserve public broadcasting materials produced for national
broadcast were underway. Hundreds of stations across the nation stored millions
of public broadcasting assets under less than optimal conditions. An important
study had produced recommendations for the future. Shifts in broadcasting
technology soon would offer an opportunity for implementing an exciting new
approach to meet the many challenges of preserving public broadcasting
materials.
