Digital technology not only offers a means for creating a universally 
acceptable archive but also allows the materials to be repurposed in a thousand 
different ways for educational and journalistic purposes.

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between WGBH 
Educational Foundation and the Library of Congress, was instituted in 2013 to 
coordinate a national effort to identify, preserve, and make accessible as much 
as possible the historical record of publicly funded broadcasting in the U.S. 
While the need for a public broadcasting archival initiative was recognized 
nearly fifty years ago, efforts and funding to methodically implement a 
nationally coordinated program did not begin in earnest until the advent of the 
digital age in the 21st century.

##20th Century – A Proposed “Library and Archives of Noncommercial Educational 
Television or Radio Programs”

The earliest conception of an archive of public media can be traced back to the 
Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting (CPB) and mandated it “to establish and maintain a library and 
archives of noncommercial educational television or radio programs and related 
materials.”[<sup>2</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#2)  A decade 
later, however, an internal Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) report concluded 
that after 24 years of noncommercial television, “there is no program archive 
or aural-visual history of public television in the United States…. There is no 
full-time staff member at any national public broadcasting organization who 
devotes his time exclusively to archive planning -- let alone 
implementation.”[<sup>3</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#3)  The 
report held out hope that with the recent passage of the American Television 
and Radio Archives (ATRA) legislation as part of the Copyright Act of 1976, the 
Library of Congress would develop a comprehensive plan “to preserve the 
nation’s radio and television history, both commercial and 
non-commercial.”[<sup>4</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#4)  ATRA 
called on the Library to establish such an archive in order “to preserve a 
permanent record of the television and radio programs which are the heritage of 
the people of the United States and to provide access to such programs to 
historians and scholars without encouraging or causing copyright 
infringement.”[<sup>5</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#5) 

After ATRA’s passage, PBS donated preprint elements for some 10,000 programs to 
the Library.[<sup>6</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#6)  PBS also 
established its own Public Television Library and Broadcast Archive in 1979, 
but the archive ceased operations in 1983 in response to a lowered budget 
forecast.[<sup>7</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#7)  Ten years 
later, PBS and the Library of Congress entered into an agreement consistent 
with ATRA for the transfer of the “best copy” of “all PBS programs that have 
been or will be broadcast ... for which PBS has not held distribution rights 
for at least 12 months, as well as related cataloging materials in hard and 
machine copy form.”[<sup>8</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#8)  
Similarly, in 1976 the Library entered into the first of a series of agreements 
with National Public Radio (NPR) to acquire, preserve, and provide researcher 
access to NPR arts, cultural, and performance program tapes dating from 1971, 
the year that NPR began operations, to 1991. NPR news and public affairs 
program tapes dating from 1971 to 1988 were stored at the National 
Archives.[<sup>9</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#9)  

Two additional public broadcasting archival initiatives of importance coincided 
with these efforts. In 1979, the first public broadcasting station archive was 
founded at WGBH, which “established a formal records management and archives 
program staffed by fulltime professional archivists,” a program that remained 
unique among public broadcasting stations in its professionalism for many 
years.[<sup>10</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#10)

Second, the National Public Broadcasting Archives (NPBA) at the University of 
Maryland was established in June 1990, with a concentration in its early years 
on preserving documents pertaining to public broadcasting entities, including 
the textual records of CPB, PBS, and NPR. Beginning in 1993, NPBA began to 
acquire moving image and audio materials as well as paper documents from 
selected institutions, including WETA, PBS, Maryland Public Television, and the 
Agency for Instructional 
Technology.[<sup>11</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#11)  NPBA’s 
curator, however, qualified the scope of the organization’s archival efforts 
that its name might seem to imply, stating, “While it is impossible to serve as 
a national central repository for all public television and radio stations, it 
is within NPBA’s mission to advise and assist stations in establishing archives 
or work out archival service agreements between stations and local universities 
or historical 
societies.”[<sup>12</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#12) 

Aware that a “cohesive, nationwide effort to safeguard and preserve American 
television and video” was needed due to “the impermanence of videotape with all 
its formats, the massive volume of generated material, and the decentralized 
and fragmentary nature of production processes in the United States compared to 
those of other countries,” the Library of Congress in 1994 called for “a 
national study on the state of American television and video materials” and the 
“development of a national television and video preservation plan,” promising 
to seek congressional authorization and funding under the framework of ATRA to 
undertake these 
initiatives.[<sup>13</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#13)  The 
resultant study, Television and Video Preservation 1997, included a section on 
public television that began 

>
Despite historically small audiences, public television has been responsible 
for the production, broadcast, and dissemination of some of the most important 
programs which in [the] aggregate form the richest audiovisual source of 
cultural history in the United States. In an age where the multiplicity of 
cable television program outlets has shifted the paradigm to 
noncommercial/public television, it is still not easy to overstate the immense 
cultural value of this unique audiovisual legacy, whose loss would symbolize 
one of the great conflagrations of our age, tantamount to the burning of 
Alexandria’s library in the age of antiquity.

In contrast to this elevated prose, the study revealed that practically, 
“neither PBS nor the Library is in a position to accept or prepare all the 
materials for transfer” according to the terms of their 1993 agreement. “PBS 
needs assistance to inventory and prepare the balance of materials for 
transfer,” the study pointed out, and the Library “requires additional storage 
space and processing staff to handle 
them.”[<sup>14</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#14)  Similarly, a 
representative from a leading public broadcasting station spoke for many in the 
archival and public broadcasting community when he lamented that “having 
created a unique video record of American arts, ideas, history, nature and 
sciences, public television is far too financially vulnerable to salvage what 
it has created.”[<sup>15</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#15)

Despite these apprehensions, the study maintained an optimistic attitude. PBS, 
it noted, stored the master materials that had not been transferred to the 
Library in a climate controlled facility.  Descriptive information about 
individual programs was not publicly accessible, however, and “no single 
centralized inventory or descriptive database system” 
existed.[<sup>16</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#16)

In addition to surveying nationally produced and distributed public 
broadcasting preservation efforts, the study addressed the state of local 
programming preservation practices as well. “There are many affiliate 
productions that were never broadcast on PBS,” the study stated, recommending 
that the system’s 345 affiliates should “identify their own indigenous programs 
and make them a priority for preservation.” The NPBA curator noted that “a lot 
of moving image material out there is collected in historical societies and 
stations ... under environment conditions that are less than 
optimal.”[<sup>17</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#17)  Even WGBH, 
public broadcasting’s most professional station archive, lacked proper 
facilities to store color film – which made up 85% of its film collection – for 
the long term.[<sup>18</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#18)

The study offered a plan for the future that prioritized coordination to help 
stations and archives make informed preservation decisions, more funding for 
preservation, and increased professionalism: 

>
Probably the greatest need to shore up the preservation activities of public 
broadcasting is simply coordination, which can be brought about by the sharing 
of information.… 

>
The creation and sharing of comprehensive inventory databases seem essential 
for achieving any real success in coordinating the efforts of affiliates…. 

>
Since the Library of Congress has assumed responsibility for storing, 
processing, re-formatting and servicing all past, present, and future PBS 
transmissions, the Library will ultimately require additional funding which 
should come from CPB…. 

>
Affiliates that are part of state or municipal entities should seek local or 
regional funding for preservation activities …. 

>
Affiliates should take a close look at the WGBH Media Archives and Preservation 
Center as a model for some of the larger producers of programming 
material.[<sup>19</sup>](/about-the-american-archive/history/page3#19) 

At the end of the 20th century, scattered initiatives by professional 
archivists to preserve public broadcasting materials produced for national 
broadcast were underway. Hundreds of stations across the nation stored millions 
of public broadcasting assets under less than optimal conditions. An important 
study had produced recommendations for the future. Shifts in broadcasting 
technology soon would offer an opportunity for implementing an exciting new 
approach to meet the many challenges of preserving public broadcasting 
materials.
