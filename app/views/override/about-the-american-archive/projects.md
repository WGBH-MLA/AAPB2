## American Archive of Public Broadcasting Permanent Entity Grant

In April 2013, Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) selected WGBH and the Library of Congress as the permanent stewards of the American Archive. The initial two-year project funded by CPB is currently underway. During this first phase, AAPB will accomplish the following tasks: 

- Complete the digitization of approximately 40,000 hours of public television and radio selected by more than 100 stations and organizations across the country;

- Select and transcode approximately 5,000 hours of born-digital files to be added to the collection;

- Access and ingest the digital files into the Library of Congress Digital Archive;

- Provide on-site access to the entire collection at the Library of Congress and WGBH;

- Catalog as many inventory records as possible;

- Create and implement a rights clearance strategy to identify content that could be made available online in compliance with copyright and other legal restrictions;

- Develop a website that provides public access to inventory records and digitized content in compliance with copyright and other legal restrictions;

- Establish an Executive Advisory Council to guide the strategic direction of the AAPB;

- Create a collection development policy to guide future expansion; and

- Develop a sustainability plan to support the AAPB into the future.

## National Educational Television (NET) Collection Catalog Project

The National Educational Television (NET) Collection Catalog Project funded by CLIR is the first project to build upon the American Archive of Public Broadcasting initiative. This project, to begin in June 2015, will create a national catalog of records providing robust descriptions of programs distributed by NET (1952-1972), comprising the earliest public television content. During the project, the Library of Congress will process and catalog more than 8,000 at-risk NET programs in its collection. WGBH will aggregate inventory records from archival institutions that hold NET moving image and sound elements in order to develop a national catalog to be added to the AAPB website and made available to the public. 

The NET Collection is an invaluable record of non-commercial TV programming from 1952-1972 on public affairs, social issues, arts, culture, the humanities, science, and education. During this time period, public affairs documentaries and discussions covered the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and issues such as poverty, student activism, radicalism, privacy, the environment, the elderly, and welfare. Arts and cultural programming visually documented opinions and works of major authors, artists, musicians, filmmakers, scientists, and intellectuals. NET presented contemporary theater performed by leading repertory companies. Science series covered issues such as the latest medical advances, space exploration, and the steps that led to the 1969 moon launch. NET’s educational programming included materials for classroom use, innovative children’s programming, and adult education programs. 

Of the 8,000-10,000 NET titles, few are known to scholars because, to date, they have been preserved in unprocessed collections. With the NET Collection accessible, television studies scholars can embark on in-depth studies of the network, access its innovative series, compare commercial and noncommercial television, and examine programs that offer diverse perspectives on topics such as bias in newscasts, the effects of television on politics and on children, and federal involvement in public broadcasting.

The centralized catalog will enable institutions holding NET materials to catalog their NET materials more efficiently. Collection managers will be able to make informed preservation decisions. Researchers, teachers, students, and audiovisual producers will be able to search the catalog for programs relating to a large variety of interests and then access programs onsite at the respective institution.
