# Statement on AAPB Metadata and Transcripts

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) team seeks to make the vast AAPB collection widely accessible via metadata and transcripts. With more than 100,000 digitized programs originating from diverse locations across the United States, we regret that we are not able to fully review and catalog each individual program in the collection. We recognize that gaps and inaccuracies in metadata and transcripts can be problematic for users of the archive. 

Metadata records, often containing descriptions written at the time of a program’s production, sometimes include language that may be offensive by today’s standards. 

Transcripts created using speech-to-text tools often yields inaccuracies, in particular for lower quality audio, programs that contain a variety of different types of non-speech sounds, and those featuring speakers with regional or cultural accents or dialects. 

If you have concerns about a metadata record or transcript, please contact aapb_notifications@wgbh.org so that we can review the metadata record or transcript and make needed corrections.
