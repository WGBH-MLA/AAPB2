# Online Reading Room Rules of Use

Open Vault is a project managed by WGBH Educational Foundation ("WGBH"). Open
Vault makes accessible significant historical content created by WGBH, and the
Open Vault Online Reading Room (the “ORR”) plays a central role in our mission.
In the ORR, you can view and listen digitized archival materials free of
charge. We make the ORR and all content therein available in accordance with
the copyright law of the United States, including the legal doctrine of fair
use (17 U.S.C. 107), for research, educational, and informational purposes only.

## 1. Authorized Users

By using or accessing the ORR, you accept and agree to be bound by these Rules
of Use (“Rules”). If you are using the ORR on behalf of an organization, you
accept these Rules on behalf of your organization, agree that your organization
is bound by these Rules, and represent that you have the authority to bind your
organization to these Rules. In such cases, “you” and “your” refers to both you
as an individual and your organization. We reserve the right to revoke your
authorization to use the ORR in our sole discretion at any time.

## 2. Authorized Uses

**2.a.** The ORR is providing access to materials from WGBH for research,
educational, and informational purposes only. Use of the ORR content for any
other purpose is unauthorized. You are authorized to use audiovisual content in
the ORR for private viewing on a streaming, non-downloadable basis. We make no
warranty with regard to the use of the ORR content for these or other purposes.

**2.b.** You are solely responsible for legal assessments regarding your use of any
ORR content other than as explicitly authorized by these Rules, and for
securing any legally required permissions for such use,
such as may relate to intellectual property laws and rights of publicity and
privacy.

**2.c.** You may link to materials from this website without seeking permission as
long as you properly credit WGBH as follows: *Title*, *Date*, WGBH, Boston, MA.
Only other authorized users will be able to follow your link.

**2.d.** If you use the ORR in connection with any research that results in a
publication, we request that you credit WGBH in your bibliography (if any) and
that you include in the citation a unique Open Vault web address for each Open
Vault record cited. Open Vault includes many similarly titled materials, so to
ensure that future users can easily locate the records you have cited, we
advise the use of unique Open Vault web addresses.

**2.e.** In using or accessing the ORR, you agree not to (i) act in any way that
might give rise to civil or criminal liability, (ii) collect or store personal
data about anyone, (iii) infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, or other
proprietary rights of any person, (iv) violate anyone’s rights of privacy,
publicity, or any other personal right, (v) interfere with the activities of
any other user or of Open Vault, its servers, or resources, (vi) use or attempt
to use any other user’s password to access the ORR, and (vii) harass or
threaten anyone.

## 3. Rights

**3.a.** ORR content may be governed by local, national, and/or international laws
and regulations, including intellectual property laws. Privacy, publicity, and
other personal rights may also apply.

**3.b.** The nature of ORR content often makes it difficult to determine the
content’s copyright status. Though WGBH tries when possible to provide
information about copyright owners and related matters in

catalog records, finding aids, and other texts that accompany collections or
individual items, which may assist you in making necessary legal
determinations, we make no representation or guarantee that such information is
accurate, complete, or current. The absence of copyright information does not
mean there is no copyright protection. ORR content may be protected by
copyright even where we have not provided any rights information. The
information we provide is not legal advice.

**3.c.** In all cases, even those where we provide you with available copyright
information, it is your responsibility to determine and satisfy all copyright
and other use restrictions before making any use of ORR content not explicitly
authorized by these Rules. Transmission or reproduction of protected items
beyond that allowed by fair use or otherwise permitted by law requires the
written permission of the rights holders. Securing such permissions may require
the payment of fees. You must make your own assessments of rights in light of
your intended use.

**3.d.** We do not own rights to all of the material in the ORR. We therefore
cannot grant or deny permission for any use of ORR content. Please keep in mind
that we may be able to make greater use of ORR content than you; we may have
rights to use and display ORR content that you may not.

**3.e.** If you have rights-related or other information about an item you've seen
on Open Vault, please contact Mike Muraszko, Digital Archives Manager, at
[openvault@wgbh.org](mailto:openvault@wgbh.org) with your contact details, the additional information, and a
link to the relevant content, so that appropriate information may be provided
to future users. If you provide us with any such materials, you grant us a
non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual right to use those materials.

**3.f.** If you are the owner of a copyright in ORR content and believe your work
has not been properly attributed to you or has been used without permission, we
want to hear from you. Please contact Mike Muraszko, Digital Archives Manager,
at [openvault@wgbh.org](mailto:openvault@wgbh.org) with your contact details, a link to the relevant
content, and a description of the location of your copyrighted material within
the content (if necessary). See our general [Terms and Conditions](/terms-and-conditions) for more
information.

## 4. Password-Protected Uses

**4.a.** We may, at our sole discretion, provide you with a password to access
certain materials not otherwise available via the ORR. In that event, this
Section 4 shall apply to your password-protected use and access of the ORR.

**4.b.** You agree to supply all required information and comply with Open Vault
procedures in requesting password-protected access. You agree that any
information you supply in connection with your request shall be accurate and
complete.

**4.c.** You agree to use your password only to access the materials for which it
was granted. No other use of your password to access the ORR is authorized.

**4.d.** Your password is personal to you. You agree not to recirculate your
password to any other people or organizations, and to report any breach in the
security of your password, or its unauthorized use, promptly to Mike Muraszko,
Digital Archives Manager at [openvault@wgbh.org](mailto:openvault@wgbh.org).

## 5. Liability

**5.a.** You agree to indemnify us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
officers, directors, trustees, and employees (collectively the “Indemnified
Parties”) from and against any and all liability, loss, claims, damages, costs,
penalties, and/or actions (including attorneys’ fees) if your use of the ORR
creates any liability for the Indemnified Parties.

**5.b.** You are solely liable for any use you make of the ORR, and you agree to
refrain from seeking indemnification from the Indemnified Parties if your use
creates any liability for you.

## 6. Rules

We reserve the right to modify the Rules at any time for any reason, without
providing you with any notice. Your continued access and use of the ORR after
any such modifications have been made will constitute your acceptance of and
agreement to be bound by such modifications. Accordingly, please review the
Rules regularly for updates.
