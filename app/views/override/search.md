# Searching the AAPB Website

The AAPB website consists of nearly 2.5 million metadata records, 72,000 of 
which describe video and audio content that has been digitized by the AAPB. The 
metadata records for all 2.5 million records are currently inventory-level and 
most have not been fully cataloged. Even so, the best way to find what you are 
looking for, or at least narrow your search on the AAPB website is to conduct 
keyword searches in the search bar. Then, you can filter the retrieved results 
using the browsing options (facets) that appear on the left side of the search 
results page.

If you type keywords into the **SEARCH BAR**, you will be searching all of the 
fields in all of the records in the AAPB Collection. This is the most fail-safe 
way to search the collection because it will retrieve relevant results based on 
the data available, even if that data has not be entered into the correct field.

You can also choose to **LIMIT YOUR SEARCH** to only the title or contributor 
fields.  This more limited search will give you more precise search results, if 
the data is correctly cataloged in the title or contributor field.  However, as 
the majority of our records are not cataloged, there is a good chance the data 
may not be in the correct field. For example, many times contributors are 
listed in the descriptions, but have not yet been pulled out and entered as 
individual contributors. So, if a limited search does not retrieve the results 
you’re looking for, try a search of all fields because the data may be in the 
record, but in the wrong field.

You can tell if something has been **DIGITIZED** based on the record's thumbnail. Digitized video has a thumbnail featuring an image from the content or program. The thumbnails for audio that has been digitized say AUDIO (digitized). The thumbnails for audio and video that hasn't been digitized will say either VIDEO (not digitized) or AUDIO (not digitized). 

From the search results page, you can use the **FACETS** menu on the left to filter 
the search results.

Using the **MEDIA TYPE** facet, you can filter your results based on if they are 
Moving Image or Sound

To filter your results based on their topic or format of the content use the 
**GENRE** facet; for example, Cooking, Arts, Nature, Talk Shows, and News Reports. 
The data in the genre field is not normalized. AAPB catalogers are working on 
this data during their efforts; however, we have made the un-normalized data 
available now, to better enhance discoverability.

The **ASSET TYPE** facet filters results based on whether they are Episodes, Clips, 
Programs, Raw Footage, etc. Asset Types have not been added to many of the 
records. Also, some Asset Types from the original inventory have not been 
normalized. We have made this imperfect data available because we felt it would 
be helpful when it does exist; however in many cases it may not exist.

If you are looking for content contributed by a specific station, or if you 
want to find materials that document the history of a certain region or area of 
the United States, use the **ORGANIZATION** facet. With this facet you can filer 
your results based on which organization contributed the records to the AAPB 
collection.

The **YEAR** facet lets you filter your results based on the year in the Asset Date 
field. Asset Dates can be the date the asset was created, broadcast, revised, 
or the copyright date of the asset.

The **ACCESS** facet is the quickest way to display only the metadata records for 
video and audio content digitized by the AAPB. All digitized assets are 
available for viewing/listening at the Library of Congress or WGBH, so this 
facet is a good way to begin your research and identify content that you may 
want to view or listen to during an on-location visit. [Click here](http://americanarchive.org/on-location) for more
