## Summary

This collection is made up of 80 episodes from three series produced locally at WSRE in Pensacola, Florida. The episodes in this collection were produced during the period from 1998 - 2010, with most of the episodes originating in the mid to late 2000s. The first series, <em>AWARE</em>, explores the varied cultural interests of the many ethnic communities throughout Northwest Florida and parts of Alabama. The second, <em>Connecting the Community</em>, is a weekly, half-hour public affairs show. The third, <em>Food for Thought</em>, is a monthly program exploring thought-provoking topics, featuring select speakers, civic presentations, and enlightening events throughout Northwest Florida. These programs address a wide range of topics, in the fields of local history, science, health/wellness, and political science. Additionally, some episodes discuss current events that are of lasting historical significance, including the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, climate change, and the outcome of the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
