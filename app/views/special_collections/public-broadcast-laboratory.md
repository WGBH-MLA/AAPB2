## Summary

The [*Public Broadcast Laboratory* (*PBL*)]( https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Public+Broadcast+Laboratory&per_page=100&sort=asset_date+asc) collection consists of approximately 55 episodes, 30 of which are available online, from a weekly live, experimental, and controversial television magazine program broadcast over National Educational Television (NET) from 1967 to 1969. The programs explore a wide range of social, cultural, and political topics, including school desegregation, environmental issues, avant-garde theater, police-minority relations, poverty, elections, student protests, civil unrest, the meat industry, the defense establishment, bias in TV news, and the Vietnam War. Hosted by seasoned network radio broadcaster Edward P. Morgan with assistance from correspondents Tom Pettit and Robert MacNeil, the first season featured two-hour episodes with multiple segments, while the second season shifted to 90-minute episodes each focused on a single topic. Some programs demonstrated the possibilities of live interconnection between stations. Others presented cinema vérité, or observational documentaries by [Frederick Wiseman](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-75-246q5bz0), [Richard Leacock](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-s756d5qg28), [Arthur Barron and Gene Marner](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-3f4kk9555p), [Richard Pearce](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-512-028pc2v166), [Fred Wardenburg and Don Lenzer](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-g44hm53h63), a “psycho-docu-drama” by French journalist [Danielle Hunebelle](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-qz22b8wh8d), an investigative report from London correspondent [Revel Guest](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-3775t3gt9j), and a documentary chronicling the final months in the life of [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-sj19k46z5q) *PBL* profiled [Ingmar Bergman](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-9g5gb1zd58), [Johnny Cash](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-512-nk3610ws9j), [Louise Day Hicks](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-9zg6g70c), [Ronald Reagan](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-94hmh6vt), [Sir John Gielgud](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-zk55d8pp4n), and [Buckminster Fuller](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-7w6736mz7m).

Though *PBL*’s interconnectedness across the country was revolutionary in many ways, critics considered the program’s content controversial, and it aired on fewer affiliate stations than its producers had hoped.   

## Background

Created and funded by the Ford Foundation, *PBL* began as a two-year, $10 million effort to liven up the existing state of educational television. Organizationally, *PBL* operated distinct from NET. Many accomplished producers and reporters participated in *PBL*. State networks in South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia declined to carry *PBL* due to the provocative nature of some topics, and *PBL* dissolved shortly before NET’s absorption into New York public television in 1970. This special collection was curated in 2022 by Sonia Prasad, a graduate of Williams College, as part of the Library of Congress Archives, History, and Heritage Advanced Internship (AHHA) program.
