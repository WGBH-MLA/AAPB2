## Background

To highlight the breadth of material available to the public, content for this collection was curated from AAPB's Online Reading Room. Throughout Summer 2018, AAPB staff will share clips of programs on AAPB's social media outlets, and you can view the programs in-full within the AAPB Road Trip Special Collection. Segmented clips and their full programs can be found using the AAPB Road Trip interactive map.

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between the Library of Congress and WGBH Education Foundation in Boston, preserves and makes accessible historic public radio and television created over the past 70+ years.

## Funders

## Help
The search box in this collection can be used to search full programs described at the item level. These programs have chapter headings to make it easier to navigate between different segments of the program. You can select from the chapter headings by hovering over the bullet-pointed list icon on the bottom right of the media player.

For this special collection, AAPB staff created short clips, which can be seen on an [interactive map](https://americanarchivepb.wordpress.com/2018/07/02/aapb-road-trip). The clips themselves are not assets in the AAPB catalog, so they can not be searched.
