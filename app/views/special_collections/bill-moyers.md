## Summary

Bill Moyers has been a broadcast journalist for more than five decades and is recognized as one of the unique voices of our times, one that resonates with multiple generations. The Museum of Broadcast Communications calls Moyers "One of the few broadcast journalists who might be said to approach the stature of Edward R. Murrow. If Murrow founded broadcast journalism, Moyers significantly extended its traditions."

With his wife and creative partner, Judith Davidson, Moyers produced such groundbreaking public affairs series as [*NOW with Bill Moyers* (2002-05)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=NOW+with+Bill+Moyers&sort=asset_date+asc), [*Bill Moyers Journal* (three installments between 1972-2010)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Bill+Moyers+Journal&sort=asset_date+asc) and [*Moyers & Company* (2012-14)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bcontributing_organizations%5D%5B%5D=Public+Affairs+Television+%26+Doctoroff+Media+Group+%28NY%29&q=%22Moyers+%26+Company%22&sort=asset_date+asc).

## Background

Moyers began his journalism career at age 16 as a cub reporter for his hometown daily newspaper in Marshall, Texas. He was a founding organizer and deputy director of the Peace Corps and special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Moyers served as Johnson’s press secretary from 1965 to 1967.
As publisher of Newsday from 1967 to 1970, Moyers brought aboard writers including Pete Hamill, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and Saul Bellow, and led the paper to two Pulitzer Prizes. In 1976, he was the senior correspondent for the distinguished documentary series *CBS Reports* and later a senior news analyst for the *CBS Evening News*.

In 1986, when Bill Moyers left CBS News, he founded Public Affairs Television (PAT) with the veteran broadcast journalist Joan Konner. When Konner became dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University in 1988, Judith Davidson Moyers, an educator, corporate board member, and creative adviser to the Corporation for Entertainment and Learning, joined the company as president.

PAT was widely acclaimed for its innovative and courageous exploration of subjects ranging from politics and the environment to the role of the media in democracy to the world of ideas. PAT was also a leader within public television in extending the reach of its broadcasts through the creative use of multimedia campaigns aimed at informing Americans of critical issues and involving them in cooperative efforts for the renewing of democracy.

In the first year it was bestowed, Moyers received the prestigious Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts by the American Film Institute. A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he also received the Career Achievement Award from the International Documentary Association and has been honored by the Television Critics Association for outstanding career achievement.

Moyers was elected to the Television Hall of Fame in 1995. A year later he received the Charles Frankel Prize (now the National Humanities Medal) from the National Endowment for the Humanities "for outstanding contributions to American cultural life." In 2005, Moyers received the PEN USA Courageous Advocacy Award for his passionate, outspoken commitment to freedom of speech and his dedication to journalistic integrity.
