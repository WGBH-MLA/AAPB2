## Background

In April 2000, the WGBH Media Library and Archives in Boston was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Archives and Special Collections Preservation and Access grant to arrange, describe, and reformat the master tapes dating from 1968 to 1982 to keep the *Say Brother* collection accessible. Recently added to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, the collection is now preserved for posterity at the Library of Congress.
