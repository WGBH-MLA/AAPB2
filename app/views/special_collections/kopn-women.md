## Summary

The <em>Feminist Community Radio</em> Collection includes programming at KOPN from the 1970s to the 1990s, and functions as a window into feminist discourse in Missouri during an era of major changes. It encompasses the annual Women's Day or Women's Weekend broadcasts, as well as several programs that were year-round features at the station. Both local and national organizations created programming at KOPN, including the Columbia chapter of the League of Women Voters as well as the more idiosyncratic Crystal Set Feminists. The subject material of the collection is also diverse, ranging from highly local election debate to discussions of the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, and from women breaking into the higher levels of the health professions to the treatment of incarcerated women. Because of the nature of the station, the collection is incomplete, as many reels of tape have been lost over the decades. However, KOPN's feminist radio history provides an uncommon entrance point into understanding life in the Midwest.

## Background

KOPN was founded in Columbia, Missouri in 1973, as an alternative to the first local radio station in town, which the founders of KOPN felt was not responsive enough to the community. Its mission from the beginning was to amplify the voices of marginalized groups in the area, as signified by the call sign they chose: K-OPN, a station <em>open</em> to the community at large. The inaugural Women's Day program took place in 1977, and by the second, in March 1978, it was already becoming an institution. In addition to, and preceding, the annual Women's Day tradition, several weekly programs covered women's issues in politics, health, and society.
