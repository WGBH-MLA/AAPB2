## Summary

The Watergate Hearings Collection covers 51 days of broadcasts of the Watergate Hearings from May 17, 1973 to November 15, 1973. The hearings, which aired at 8PM ET, were recorded by the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) and broadcast in full, or “gavel to gavel”, by PBS, so that viewers unable to watch during the day were able to watch the complete proceedings in the evening. Anchors Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer provided summaries, commentary, and interviews to supplement each broadcast. The coverage includes testimony from James McCord, one of the men arrested for breaking into the Watergate complex; John Dean, White House counsel from July 1970 to April 1973; Carl M. Shoffler, a policeman who arrested the burglars in the Watergate complex; H.R. Haldeman, President Nixon’s Chief of Staff; and L. Patrick Gray, Acting Director of the FBI from May 1972 to April 1973. A full cast of characters is available in our [“Gavel-to-Gavel” exhibit](http://americanarchive.org/exhibits/watergate/cast-of-characters).
