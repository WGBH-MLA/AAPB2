## Summary

Ken Burns’ <em>The Civil War</em> Interviews Collection consists of eight full interviews conducted by Burns with historians, writers, and commentators concerning the history and politics of the American Civil War. The interviews were recorded on film by Ken Burns and associates between 1986 and 1988 as part of Ken Burns’ award winning documentary, <em>The Civil War</em>, which originally aired on PBS stations from September 23rd to September 27th, 1990. The recordings include cuts, incidental conversation, production notes, and segments with sound but not film, and vary in length between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours. The questions asked of interviewees are usually audible. The interviews were digitized as part of the 25th anniversary restoration of the original film and provided to the AAPB in fall 2016.

## Help

Records are described at an item level and all records contain brief descriptions and subject terms. All records have complete text transcripts. Complete original PDF transcripts exist for three of the eight interviews: Ed Bearss, Stephen Oates, and Robert Penn Warren. Incomplete original PDF transcripts exist for the interviews with Daisy Turner, C. Vann Woodward, and William Safire. Additionally, the PDF transcripts do not always include text of questions asked of interviewees (but the questions are typically audible in the video). Some of the PDF versions of transcripts contain more information, such as handwritten notes and timestamps, than is contained in the cleaned up transcript text displayed in the website transcript viewer. Chapter headings in the video player allow for the user to navigate recording by the topics that are discussed.
