## Background

*The Robert MacNeil Report* went on the air on October 20, 1975 and has continued under subsequent series titles through the present, now known as the *PBS NewsHour*. *PBS NewsHour* is produced by NewsHour Productions LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Greater Washington Educational Television Authority (WETA). In 2016, the Council on Library and Information Resources awarded a grant to WGBH, the Library of Congress, and WETA to digitize, preserve and make publicly accessible the *PBS NewsHour* Collection. Transcripts for the majority of the collection were provided by the NewsHour. The entire digitized collection will be available by January 2019, with the exception of missing dates. As of July 2018, AAPB is currently missing 545 episodes that have not been located through the digitization project.
