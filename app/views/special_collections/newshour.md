## Background

*The Robert MacNeil Report* went on the air on October 20, 1975 and has continued under subsequent series titles through the present, now known as the *PBS NewsHour*. *PBS NewsHour* is produced by NewsHour Productions LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Greater Washington Educational Television Authority (WETA). In 2016, the Council on Library and Information Resources awarded a grant to WGBH, the Library of Congress, and WETA to digitize, preserve and make publicly accessible the *PBS NewsHour* Collection from 1975 - 2007. Transcripts for the majority of the collection were provided by the NewsHour. In 2018 and 2019, the Internet Archive provided copies of episodes recorded off-air from 2009 - 2019. As of February 2019, AAPB has not yet digitized the year 2008 due to limited funding. In addition, there are 545 additional episodes that have not been located.
