## Summary

The *American Masters* Interviews Collection consists of 2,191 digital files of interviews conducted with luminaries discussing America’s most enduring artistic and cultural giants. The interviews were recorded on videotape by THIRTEEN and associated producers between 1993 and 2012 for episodes of the award-winning PBS biography series *American Masters*. An interview may span more than one digital file, or a file may contain multiple interviews. Episode topics focus on a significant artist, work, or organization, and an interview will primarily concern the associated episode’s featured topic. The questions asked of interviewees are usually audible. Recordings typically range between 30 minutes and an hour in length. Researchers can access the interviews only on location at the Library of Congress and WGBH. WNET’s digitization of this collection was supported in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.

## Help

*American Masters* interviews are currently available to view on location at WGBH and the Library of Congress. The interviews are organized by the *American Masters* episode for which each interview was recorded. Each metadata record contains the series and episode titles for the corresponding production, as well as one or more raw footage titles, which contain the names of the individual(s) interviewed in the recording. An interview may span more than one file, and a file may contain multiple interviews. Interviews that span multiple files also span multiple records on the AAPB. To retrieve all interviews conducted for a specific episode, either perform a search of the episode title or locate a record of interest and click the “Episode Title” listed in the metadata record. The best way to find an interview with a specific individual is to keyword search their last name. If researching a subject, the best strategy is to browse all the raw interview recordings from episodes which concern your research topic. There are currently no descriptions of content or subject terms present in the recordings’ metadata records. There are also no transcripts for the recordings, thus at this time, keyword searching for topics will not yield useful results.
