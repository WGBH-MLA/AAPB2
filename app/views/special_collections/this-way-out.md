## Background

When *This Way Out* emerged in 1988, any attention the mainstream media paid to LGBTQ+ life, news, and culture was dominated by the AIDS epidemic. As the only international LGBTQ+ radio program, *This Way Out* is a vital platform for the communityâ€™s true stories, and an outlet for audiences worldwide to access education, information, and entertainment from its heart. The program has received numerous accolades, including awards from the U.S. National Federation Of Community Broadcasters and the Radio and Television News Association. Its contributions have been recognized by groups such as the LGBTQ+ media monitoring organization GLAAD, the queer family and ally advocacy group P-FLAG, the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA), and internationally by the Tupilak organization of Nordic lesbian and gay cultural workers. The preservation of this collection was directed by Brian DeShazor, CEO of Overnight Productions, Inc. and Producer of This Way Out Radio Newswrap.
