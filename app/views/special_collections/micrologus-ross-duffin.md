## Summary

The [*Micrologus*](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=all&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Micrologus&sort=asset_date+asc) collection contains 104 episodes of the syndicated public radio show that introduced the history of early music to millions of listeners. *Micrologus*, which first aired in 1980 with Dr. Ross W. Duffin at the helm as host and producer, was broadcast locally on WCLV in Cleveland and then syndicated for 18 years by National Public Radio until 1998. The series, which focused on early music between the 13th and 18th centuries, introduced listeners to early composers, performers, instruments, and musical traditions. Episodes in the AAPB were made during the years 1981 to 1985. Each half-hour episode features a combination of discussions, interviews, and musical excerpts. The collection includes episodes on [Gregorian chant](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-df6a4b44c11), [the music of Petrarch](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-8311db27557), [music in Shakespearean theater](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-daab96d04ec), a [memorial for musician Jason Paras](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-37911e0db5e), the [musical tradition of the Oltremontani](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-7e74d5ad24b), the [motet](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-c06bef65209), and historical instruments like the [lute](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-b3c0340802f) and [viola da gamba](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-3235bbb8c31).

An authority on early music between the 13th and 19th centuries with a specialization in 15th-century Franco-Flemish music and 16th- and 17th- century English music, Duffin directed the early music program at Case Western Reserve University from 1978 until his retirement in 2018. He is now Fynette H. Kulas Professor of Music Emeritus, and CWRU Distinguished University Professor Emeritus.
