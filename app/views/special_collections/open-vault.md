## Background

Since 1979, [GBH Archives](https://www.wgbh.org/foundation/archives) has preserved, cataloged, and provided access to materials produced by GBH for radio, television, home video, and digital platforms. The archive currently preserves nearly one million audio, video, film, and digital assets dating back to 1947. 

Created in 2005, the GBH Archives website Open Vault provides online access to unique and historically important content produced by GBH. The initial creation of Open Vault was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the prototype website was funded in part by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Additional support was provided by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In 2018, the National Endowment for the Humanities issued a challenge grant to GBH Archives to support the preservation and digitization of 83,000 of the most at-risk items in GBH’s archival collection. Open Vault was redesigned in 2024, and in 2025, the AAPB’s GBH Archives Open Vault collection was created, bringing together all digitized, GBH-produced programming in the AAPB.
