## Summary

The WUNC Public Affairs Programming Special Collection contains more than 40 hours of long-format news, features, and live music performances produced between 1976 and 1988 by WUNC, the Chapel Hill, N.C.-based NPR affiliate serving the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area of North Carolina known as the Triangle. The WUNC station format during this time span enabled producers to air in-depth interviews and host roundtable discussions on a number of topics of public interest, including state politics and government; diversity, equity, and inclusion; economic development in the Triad (made up of the cities of Greensboro, High Point, and Winston-Salem, N.C.) and Triangle regions of North Carolina; economic and educational opportunity; transportation and infrastructure; criminal justice; environment and ecosystem; public health; and the performing and fine arts. This coverage, notable for both its depth and its breadth, served as a platform for diverse voices from across North Carolina in addition to widening the audience for high-profile events taking place on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill. The reporter and producer of many of these segments was Fay Mitchell Henderson, a Black graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and a native of Eastern North Carolina.

## Background

WUNC began broadcasting in the 1940s and operated as a student radio station from 1952 until 1970. It was off the air for six years, until it was revived as an NPR affiliate on April 3, 1976, with a mix of news, commentary, and music. It broadcast from Swain Hall on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill, in basement studios adjacent to its sister television station, WUNC-TV. The recordings in this collection are a reflection of the station’s format for the subsequent 25 years, before it switched to a 24-hour local and national programming format. This special collection was digitized through the American Archive of Public Broadcasting’s Public Broadcast Preservation Fellowship, funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and curated by AAPB Fellow Michelle Moriarity Witt.
