## Summary

The <em>Eyes on the Prize I</em> Interviews Collection consists of 127 raw interviews conducted with participants in the American Civil Rights movement, covering the years from the mid-1950s through to 1965. The interviews were recorded by Henry Hampton and the Blackside production company as part of the acclaimed documentary series <em>Eyes on the Prize: America’s Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965</em>. The series originally aired on PBS in 1987, and was followed by a second series in 1990, <em>Eyes on the Prize: II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965-1985</em>. The series garnered several Emmy awards, a Peabody, and an Academy Award nomination, and is considered the definitive documentary on the Civil Rights Movement. The recordings include cuts, incidental conversation, production notes, and segments with sound but not film; some interviews are sound only. The questions asked of interviewees are usually audible, and interviews range in length from ten minutes to two hours. The interviews were reconstructed and digitized from the original film materials by the Film & Media Archive at Washington University.
