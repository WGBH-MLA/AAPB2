## Summary

[*Weather Whys*](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=all&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Weather+Whys&sort=asset_date+asc), a daily series from the early 1990s, discusses some of the phenomena of the unpredictable and severe weather of Oklahoma, along with other meteorological topics. Created and broadcast by KGOU Radio, this series of 365 two-minute episodes was a production of the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms at the University of Oklahoma and made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The University of Oklahoma is home to the National Weather Service. Covering everything from tornadoes to downbursts, this series sought to inform listeners on the “why” of what is happening in the sky. *Weather Whys* serves as a glimpse into meteorology from this period and allows one to see the advancements in both meteorological technology and knowledge.
