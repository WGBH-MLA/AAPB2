Known and respected for its non-biased approach, *Here and Now* presents stories from a variety of viewpoints. Each week host Federica Freyberg takes a deep and measured investigation into the major issues facing the state. Topics range from local and national politics and economics to natural resource stewardship and the impact of gun violence. *Here and Now* provides an insider’s view to the governorships of Jim Doyle, Scott Walker, and Tony Evers, including major state stories that made the national news: effects of the Great Recession on Wisconsin residents and businesses, including the shutdown of the Janesville General Motors plant in 2008; the divisive 2011 “Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill,” leading to months of mass protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and recall elections throughout the state; Wisconsin’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the August 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha and the deadly unrest that followed; and the contested November 2020 election that divided the state and the nation. Guests on the show are subject experts from around the state and the nation, politicians, and local leaders, including UW Madison Chief Diversity Officer [Patrick Sims](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Here+and+Now&sort=asset_date+asc&q=%22patrick+sims%22); gubernatorial candidate [Mary Burke](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Here+and+Now&sort=asset_date+asc&q=%22mary+burke%22); Rep.

In 1986, the station took on the name Wisconsin Public Television, and in 2019 it was renamed to PBS Wisconsin. PBS Wisconsin contributed episodes of *Here and Now* to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting starting in 2018.
