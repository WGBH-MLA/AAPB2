## Summary

The <em>Woman </em> Series Collection consists of 197 episodes of the <em>Woman</em> series produced by WNED in Buffalo, New York from 1972-1977. <em>Woman</em> was a half-hour public affairs talk show covering issues of interest to women. The first season, which aired locally, was hosted by Samantha Dean. From 1973 - 1977, PBS syndicated the series, and producer Sandra Elkin became the show’s host. Each episode focused on a single topic with featured guest discussants. Guests included well-known and lesser-known activists, journalists, writers, scholars, lawyers, artists, psychologists, doctors and others such as Gloria Steinem, editor and co-founder of Ms. Magazine; Dorothy Pitman Hughes, African American activist and co-founder of Ms. Magazine; Betty Friedan, author of *The Feminine Mystique*; Florynce Kennedy, founder of the National Feminist Party; Margaret Sloan, co-founder of the National Black Feminist Organization; Karen DeCrow, then president of the National Organization for Women; Margaret Dunkle of the Project on the Status of Women for the Association of American Colleges; and Ruth Miller of the Buffalo Planned Parenthood Association. Topics discussed on the show included women in sports, the Equal Rights Amendment, sexuality, marriage, women’s health, divorce, the Women’s Liberation Movement, motherhood, and ageism, among others.

## Background

The <em>Woman</em> Series was contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) by WNED during the first major AAPB digitization project funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 2012. Once digitized, the show’s producer and host Sandra Elkin assisted AAPB archivists in cataloging the digitized collection.

## Funders

## Help

Research is ongoing to determine whether the 197 episodes preserved in the AAPB represent the complete <em>Woman</em> series. Records are described at an item level and all records contain brief descriptions and subject terms. Search by keyword or individual, or browse all episodes by clicking “Explore the Collection” below the search box.

A few of the recordings in the collection consist of segments from multiple programs, and one recording in the collection is a 1976 proposal video for the next season. Two of the episodes in the collection are not available in the Online Reading Room and are only available for research on location at WGBH and the Library of Congress.
