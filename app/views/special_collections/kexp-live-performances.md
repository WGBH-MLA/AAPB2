The genres featured in this collection are various and include blues, pop, rock, electronic rock, alternative rock, and more. Today many of these bands and artists continue to create music, some having reached international recognition.

## Background

KEXP has been at the heart of Seattle's thriving music scene for the past five decades. Founded in 1972 as student- and volunteer-run KCMU at the University of Washington, the radio station became community supported in 1981 following budget cuts from the university. In 1986, the station increased their wattage to 400 watts and moved their transmitter to reach a 15-mile radius audience. With help from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, KCMU became KEXP 90.3 FM in 2001, moving to a high-tech study and increasing its wattage further to 720. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit arts organization formed at the same time, KEXP’s mission is to “enrich your life by championing music and discovery.” Designed to benefit music lovers, artists, and the arts community, KEXP continues to be a station powered by the community, reaching nearly 300,000 listeners around the world through on-air and online services.
