The majority of the digitized material is from a series created by the University of Alabama Center for Public Television and Radio called *The Alabama Experience*, which ran for two decades. The series focused on bringing to life the inspiring stories and empowering people that helped form Alabama’s past and are working to shape its future. Two of the main producers for the series were Max Shores and Carolyn Hales. Other digitized pieces are specials and documentaries created by the University of Alabama’s Center for Public Television and Radio.

## Background

Housed in a multimedia product and broadcast facility, the University of Alabama Center for Public Television and Radio (CPT&R) has been producing content for public broadcasting for 57 years. It is located in the Digital Media Center (DMC) found in Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on the University of Alabama’s campus. 

CPT&R’s main mission is to educate, inform, and inspire Alabamians through their production of high quality radio, television, and new media programs and content. Their second goal is to provide opportunities for students interested in media production and broadcasting. This was the inspiration behind the Digital Media Center, which is home to the Center for Public Television, Alabama Public Radio, WVUA 23, and Crimson Tide Productions. It’s in the DMC that students gain experience in public broadcasting, radio, and new media.

This collection of work from CPT&R was digitized in the Fall of 2019 and Spring of 2020 by Hannah Hurdle, a Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellow at the University of Alabama’s School of Library and Information Studies, in collaboration with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.
