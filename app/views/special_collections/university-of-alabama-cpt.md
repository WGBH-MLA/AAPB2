## Background

Housed in a multimedia production and broadcast facility, the University of Alabama Center for Public Television and Radio (CPT&R) has been producing content for public broadcasting for 57 years. It is located in the Digital Media Center (DMC) found in Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on the University of Alabama’s campus. 

CPT&R’s main mission is to educate, inform, and inspire Alabamians through their production of high quality radio, television, and new media programs and content. Their second goal is to provide opportunities for students interested in media production and broadcasting. This was the inspiration behind the Digital Media Center, which is home to the Center for Public Television, Alabama Public Radio, WVUA 23, and Crimson Tide Productions. It’s in the DMC that students gain experience in public broadcasting, radio, and new media.

This collection of work from CPT&R was digitized in the Fall of 2019 and Spring of 2020 by Hannah Hurdle, and in the Fall of 2021 and Spring of 2022 by Elizabeth Meads, in their capacities as Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellows at the University of Alabama’s School of Library and Information Studies, in collaboration with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.
