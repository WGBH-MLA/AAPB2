Produced by Morgan Holm and moderated by Stephanie Fowler, the show featured news reports accompanied by discussions with journalists and others on current events in Oregon. Some recurring guests included David Reinhard (The Oregonian), Hasso Hering (Albany Democrat-Herald), Dana Haynes (Lake Oswego Review), Mark Zusman (Willamette Week), Naseem Rakha (Salem Public Radio), and Bridget Barton (Brainstorm Magazine), among many others. Themes discussed in the show include the environment, politics, education, health, and business, and many of the topics addressed continue to be extremely relevant, and some still controversial today, such as school shootings, abortion, and the legalization of marijuana.
