## Summary

The <em>BackStory</em> Collection contains 154 episodes from the popular public radio series and podcast on timely topics in American history. The series, which delves into the history, or “backstory” of current events and ideas in the U.S., is produced by Virginia Humanities, a state humanities council tasked with connecting Virginians to their state’s history and culture. <em>BackStory</em> began as a monthly public radio show in 2008 with hosts Ed Ayers, Peter Onuf, and Brian Balogh known collectively as “The American History Guys.” In 2017, BackStory began publishing as a podcast only. Onuf transitioned to a consulting and guest host role and historians Nathan Connolly and Joanne Freeman joined the team. In episodes, <em>BackStory</em>’s hosts, all renowned historians and educators, discuss connections between the present and the past in a way that, according to the show’s website, “makes learning about history like going to a lively cocktail party.” Along with the hosts, episodes regularly feature guest historians and questions from audience callers. Episodes in the collection feature conversations about how subjects with deep roots in American history and culture – censorship, conspiracy theories, maps, dating and courtship, death and mourning, the color green, taxation, guns, populism, satire, and women in politics – have impacted American lives, often in surprising ways. Subjects in this collection include American history, women, race, racism, social life, education, religion, politics, economics, health, immigration, war, and holidays. 

Ed Ayers is President Emeritus at the University of Richmond and member of the AAPB Executive Advisory Council who was named National Professor of the Year, received the National Humanities Medal from President Obama at the White House, and won the Bancroft, Beveridge, and Lincoln prizes in American history. Peter Onuf is the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History, Emeritus, at the University of Virginia and Senior Research Fellow for the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello, and has written extensively on Thomas Jefferson. Brian Balogh is a Professor of History at the University of Virginia and recipient of the American Historical Association’s 2015 Nancy Lyman Roelker Award who has written about 19th- and 20th- century America. Nathan Connolly is the Herbert Baxter Adams Associate Professor of History at Johns Hopkins University, an award-winning author whose work explores immigration and the experience of people of color in America. Joanne Freeman is a professor of History and American Studies at Yale University and recipient of the DeVane Award for Teaching and Scholarship by Yale University in 2017, whose work focuses on early national political culture and political violence.
