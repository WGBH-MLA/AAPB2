## Summary

In 2017 the Walter J. Brown Media Archives & Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia (BMA) and WGBH were awarded a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to digitize, preserve, and provide access to public broadcasting programming nominated for George Foster Peabody Awards between 1941 and 1999. Established in 1940, the George Foster Peabody Awards celebrate excellence in storytelling on television, radio, and online media in categories including education, children’s programming, news, and documentaries. The programs, which will eventually be comprised of approximately 4,000 digitized hours of audio and video recordings from 230 local, state, and regional public broadcasting stations in 46 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, is currently being digitized and will be put onto the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) on a rolling basis between 2019 and 2021. The collection includes documentaries, public affairs programs, and science, health, children’s and cultural programming featuring literature, music, art, and theater. Only 12% were broadcast nationally; the remainder were only seen in their respective local viewing areas. Each program was submitted to the Peabody Awards by its creators as an exemplar of their finest work. One hundred seventy-three of the programs are Peabody winners. Materials added to the AAPB to date on include an episode of <em>Crocker Snow Reports from Germany</em> with a history of postwar Berlin; <em>Zoom</em>, an unscripted children’s educational TV show from WGBH; <em>Dying</em>, an intimate two-part documentary following individuals affected by the process of death; <em>Police Safety Program</em>, a WNYC program dedicated to educating children about traffic safety; an episode of <em>Agronsky At Large</em> featuring an interview with Muhammad Ali, and an episode of <em>It’s Your Government</em>, a WKAR series dedicated to educating Michigan citizens about the state’s laws and government. 

## Background

The BMA was established in 1995, with the Peabody Awards Collection as the basis of the archive. Access to the collection is currently available onsite at the BMA, and new materials continue to be added to the Peabody Awards Collection after each awards season. In 2017 the BMA and WGBH were awarded a federal grant to digitize, preserve, and provide access to programming submitted to the George Foster Peabody Awards program between 1941 and 1999, with materials appearing online on a rolling basis. Once digitized, the entire collection will be available for research on location at the Library of Congress and WGBH.
