## Summary

The New Jersey Network (NJN) Collection currently includes 1,800 programs and segments available online covering forty years of public television programs and series (1971-2011) from New Jersey Public Television and more than 2,000 additional programs that are available for viewing at the Library of Congress and at GBH. The collection will eventually include approximately 20,000 items in total. 
Historically one of the largest producers of local content in the public television system, NJN has a rich and varied selection of local programming. Programs cover New Jersey public, governmental, cultural, and historic affairs such as gubernatorial and senate debates, and coverage of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. More than 1,600 of the programs available online are from *New Jersey Nightly News*, dating from 1978 to 1990. This thirty-minute series, acclaimed for its in-depth local news coverage and reporting, was one of public television’s only daily news programs. The collection also includes more than 150 episodes available online from *Images/Imagenes*, an Emmy-winning series created to educate viewers on the history, needs, achievements, and culture of diverse Hispanic/Latino communities. Broadcast from 1972 (first under the title “Mi Casa Su Casa”) until 2011, and then revived in 2019, *Images/Imagenes* is the longest running Latino program on the air. Other series in the NJN Collection include *State of the Arts*, a weekly local program with New Jersey’s creative personalities; *Due Process*, the Emmy award winning legal public affairs program; *Public Affairs*, *On the Record*, *A Closer Look*, *Around and About in New Jersey*, *Made in New Jersey*, *New Jersey Outdoors*, and *New Jersey Tonight*. The collection also contains raw footage of many New Jersey locations and landmarks.

## Background

The first of four New Jersey PBS stations that eventually made up NJN, WNJT went on the air in 1971, followed in 1972 by WNJS, and in 1973 by WNJN and WNJB. NJN is the predecessor of NJ PBS, the state-controlled public television and radio service. NJN ceased operations on June 30, 2011, and Public Media NJ took control of the former NJN television stations the following day, recently rebranding itself as NJ PBS in 2022. NJN contributed items to the AAPB starting in 2014.
