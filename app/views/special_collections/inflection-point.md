## Summary

The *Inflection Point with Lauren Schiller* collection contains 137 episodes from the nationally syndicated public radio show and podcast featuring conversations with women activists, entrepreneurs, professionals, performers, academics, and authors who have been using their expertise and voices to make a difference for women everywhere. Produced in partnership with KALW 91.7FM local public radio in San Francisco and Public Radio Exchange (PRX), *Inflection Point* launched during Women’s History Month in March 2015 and continued to August 2020. During this consequential and eventful period for women, the program aired conversations with more than 200 women activists to explore, in creator and host Schiller’s words, “what women can do to rise up and have more power.” In 2020, Schiller received a Gracie Award for the show from the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation.

*Inflection Point* was named to capture and reflect a moment in history—an inflection point—when things could get better or worse for women. Over the course of the show’s five years, the series featured discussions on women in politics, the workforce, education, the tech world, and the home, and followed causes including the #MeToo movement, Black Lives Matter, and the climate change movement. *Inflection Point* took a close-up look at the changing roles of women by talking directly with women leaders about how they have taken action and made changes in politics, academia, the arts, business, activism, and more. The collection features conversations with numerous women leaders including diversity activist and software engineer Daniela Petruzalek; A’shanti Gholar, founder of the Brown Girls Guide to Politics and at the time national political director for Emerge America; sexual harassment and internet privacy lawyer Carrie Goldberg; film director Catherine Hardwicke; Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code; and Minnesota State Representative Erin Maye Quade. Guests also included a number of well-known entertainers and writers, including Lily Tomlin, Sarah Silverman, Eve Ensler, Candace Bushnell, Gail Collins, and Gloria Steinem.
