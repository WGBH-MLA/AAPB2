## Background

The digitization of the NMPM Collection was funded by a Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives grant beginning in 2020. This innovative statewide collaboration supported by public broadcasting stations across New Mexico worked to digitize programs and material recorded to be included in programs – like full interviews and raw footage shot for documentaries – that resided on obsolete and deteriorating audio and video formats, making accessible historic public media programming representing diverse communities that are underrepresented, under-resourced, and marginalized. Digitized files were received starting in 2020. Materials continue to be added to the collection as digitized items are made available.

Collaborating stations include KENW-TV at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, established in 1974; KRWG in Las Cruces, owned by the Regents of New Mexico State University since 1965; KUNM in Albuquerque, owned and operated by the University of New Mexico since 1966; New Mexico PBS (KNME) in Albuquerque, jointly owned and operated by the University of New Mexico and Albuquerque Public Schools since 1958; and KANW-FM in Albuquerque, the oldest FM radio station in New Mexico, operated by Albuquerque Public Schools since 1950. The collection also includes archival materials contributed by the New Mexico State Records Center and Archives in Santa Fe, and the University of New Mexico’s Center for Southwest Research and Special Collections in Albuquerque. David G. Griffin contributed programs he produced for KANW-FM.
