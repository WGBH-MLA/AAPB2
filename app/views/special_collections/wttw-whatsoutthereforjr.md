## Summary

In 1991, the Chicago public television series *WTTW Journal* presented a one-hour documentary entitled *What’s Out There for J.R.?*, an examination of how communities in the inner city can help children in households that cannot provide an environment for them to become independent and productive members of society. The documentary examined street gangs as a dramatic expression of how children form their own organizations to meet their own needs. *What’s Out There for J.R.?* also examined the positive impact that children can receive from supportive adults outside their families.

More than 20 people with expertise on the topics of childhood development and gangs were interviewed in the making of *What’s Out There For J.R.?* This collection consists of raw footage and interviews recorded for the documentary, with subjects ranging from academics such as [James Garbarino Ph.D.](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bcontributing_organizations%5D%5B%5D=WTTW+%28IL%29&q=James+Garbarino&sort=title+asc) (President of Erikson Institute for Advanced Study in Child Development) and [Harold Richman](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bcontributing_organizations%5D%5B%5D=WTTW+%28IL%29&sort=title+asc&q=%22Harold+Richman%22), (a professor and Director of the Chapin Hall Center for Children at University of Chicago), to gang members who discuss the initial appeal of gangs and the regrets that develop as the children mature. Also featured are social workers working with the [Department of Children and Family Services](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-1ce460c48d7), social service providers, such as [YMCA gang outreach workers](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-06c704dd3b6), and youth officers with [Chicago Police Department’s 14th police district](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-7293a779d13). 

These interviews offer insights relevant to the foundational needs of inner-city children and the ever-present possibility of growing up into a life of violence. The non-interview footage in the collection profiles 12-year-old “J.R.,” the subject of the film, and his community.

## Background

The goal of the collaboration was to explore issues of concern to the community. In 1991, the project focused on children. *What’s Out There For J.R.?* explored the state of social service networks that provide help to youths in crisis.
