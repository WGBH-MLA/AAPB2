## Background

On September 11, 2001, the United States of America experienced the largest terrorist attack and loss of human life on US soil in a single day since the Pearl Harbor Naval Station was struck by Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft on December 7, 1941. The 9/11 attack destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center complex in New York City, partially damaged the Pentagon in Washington DC, and crashed United Flight 93 in a field in rural Pennsylvania before it could reach Washington. The subsequent War on Terror led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the former of which has become the longest ongoing armed conflict in US history.

This Special Collection was curated by Robert Hoffman, graduate student at New York University’s Moving Image Archiving and Preservation Program.
