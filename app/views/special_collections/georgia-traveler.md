## Summary

The [*Georgia Traveler*](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=online&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Georgia+Traveler&per_page=20&sort=asset_date+asc) collection, an original production of Georgia Public Broadcasting, includes 40-plus digitized episodes of a weekly travel television series. Each 30-minute episode reveals the character of the Peach State. Just like the state’s Vidalia onion, each episode offers another sweet bite. The episodes were broadcast between 2009 and 2013 with host David Zelski and a crew of other colorful guides. Memorable episodes include tastes of a [bacon peanut-butter burger](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-351e42c390f); a wild, dusty off-road trek through the [Durhamtown Plantation Sportsman’s Resort](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-4a5a4d828d3); and a [ghostly stroll through Civil War battlefields and lush antebellum cemeteries](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-5975f7ce739). Viewers are also guided through the underground [rum-smuggling tunnels of Savannah](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-6d3cd1a113b) and hear tales from the mischievous childhood of slain [civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-067172e1923) The series features [ziplining fun through old canopy trees](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-680da39451a), glamorous mountain views and serene sunsets along [Georgia’s Golden Isles](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-812d832922b). The series highlights what makes Georgia shine. You’ll laugh with Georgians at quirky festivals such as the [Fire Ant Festival](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-40ae4908ecb), the [Mountain Moonshine Festival](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-9ddb2330c5b), and the [Shrimp and Grits Festival](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-121cb942c0f). Watch the [“live birth” of a Cabbage Patch Kid](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-ecaedf40514) and take in a last meal after touring the [Crime and Punishment Museum](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-40ae4908ecb), where tourists have a proclivity to pose for photographs while sitting in a replica of an electric chair called, “Old Sparky.” There is something for all ages regardless of the episode that you choose to view. At the end of the journey, you will be left excitedly asking, “Where to next?”
