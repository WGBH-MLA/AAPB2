## Summary

The Jewish American Heritage Collection provides nearly 400 public television and radio programs from 1945 to 2017 that focus on social, cultural, and religious aspects of Jewish life in America. Programs profile diverse Jewish communities in a variety of locales and address subjects relevant to many American Jews, such as anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, Israel, intermarriage, the political impact of Jewish voters, the campaign to free Soviet Jews, and relations between American Jews and African Americans. The collection includes interviews with authors whose work have explored themes of Jewish life in America, such as [Philip Roth](/catalog/cpb-aacip_516-fq9q23rx97), [Erica Jong](/catalog/cpb-aacip_75-77fqzkk3#at_1858.145309_s), [Isaac Bashevis Singer](/catalog/cpb-aacip_529-mg7fq9rg87), and [Herman Wouk](/catalog/cpb-aacip_80-48sbcwj6). Programs are devoted to the involvement of Jewish leaders in the civil rights and human rights movements, Jewish religious observances, Jewish organizations, Jewish humor, Jewish cooking, klezmer music, and Jewish art. The CUNY TV series [Jewish Women in America](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=digitized&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Jewish+Women+In+America&sort=title+asc) (2003-2004), hosted by historian Blanche Wiesen Cook, provides interviews with notable Jewish women on their contributions to U.S. society. The WRVR Riverside Church series [Portion of the Week: The Bible as Read in the Synagogue with Rabbinic Commentary](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=online&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=Portion+of+the+Week&sort=asset_date+asc) (1961-1966) offers 295 programs on weekly Torah readings by Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform rabbis from synagogues in the greater New York City area.
