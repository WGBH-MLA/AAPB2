## Summary

The [*About Science*](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=online&f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=About+science&page=1&sort=asset_date+asc) Series Collection is made up of 75 radio interviews focused on the advancements of science. Produced by the California Institute of Technology, the series aired on KPCC in Pasadena from 1966 to 1968 and was made available nationally through National Educational Radio, the precursor to National Public Radio (NPR). Hosted by California Institute of Technology faculty members Dr. Peter Lissaman, Dr. Albert R. Hibbs, and Dr. Robert Meghreblian, each half-hour episode introduced one or more experts who examined a specific area of interest. Episodes like “[About lead in the atmosphere](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-500-fn10t34k)” and “[About developments in family planning](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-500-qj77z05j)” provide a unique lens into the technological, political, social, and environmental concerns of the time. Many episodes shed light on advancements that have only become more relevant today, such as “[About computer languages](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-500-4b2x7606),” “[About international cooperation in space](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-500-4j0b0r6m),” and “[About ocean pollution](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-500-j09w4z38).”
