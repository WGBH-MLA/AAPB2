  The AAPB is committed to complying with copyright law. Unfortunately, this means that sometimes we are unable to make available materials that you would like to see online. Most AAPB users understand this, and comply with our terms and conditions. However, recently, a user improperly downloaded episodes of Sesame Street that were restricted to AAPB premises. The restriction was based on both our agreement with the creators of Sesame Street and copyright law. AAPB has arranged for takedown of these episodes from the Internet Archive and YouTube, and has tightened security. For now, we have been forced to remove any AAPB access to Sesame Street. The archive will still be available on premises at the Library of Congress Moving Image Research Center to all registered users. We regret that the actions of a few irresponsible Sesame Street fans mean that other fans are now deprived of legal access to this cultural treasure on AAPB. We thank you for your understanding.
