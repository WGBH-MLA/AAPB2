## About

PBS SoCal is the primary PBS station for more than 18 million people across six diverse Southern California counties. They provide content and experiences that inspire, inform and entertain - over the air, online, in the community and in the classroom. PBS SoCal is a donor-supported community institution and a content channel of the Public Media Group of Southern California, formed by the 2018 merger of PBS SoCal and KCETLink Media Group.

## Productions

PBS SoCal’s production history under its former name, KOCE-TV, included content about Orange County and California.  The archive collection includes the “Orange County History Project,” and a statewide documentary series called “California Dreams.”  Public affairs series such as “Jim Cooper’s Orange County” included many local election debates.  The assimilation of Southeast Asian immigrants following the Vietnam War was a significant content topic. The collection includes interviews with Pres. Gerald Ford, William F. Buckley, Howard Jarvis and many former Governors and US Senators.
