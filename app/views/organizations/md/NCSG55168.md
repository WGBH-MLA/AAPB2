## About

For more than six decades, PBS North Carolina has educated, entertained and evolved—from B&W screens in homes to glowing screens with streaming content everywhere. 

We’re an innovative multimedia platform, embodying everything you love about PBS and connecting North Carolinians to their communities and the world at large.

As your statewide public media network, we harness the power of the UNC System to:

    Spark lifelong curiosity and wonder,
    Share trusted PBS news, programming and resources,
    Engage with complex local and national issues,
    Offer opportunities for lifelong learning,
    Raise the level of discourse around science, arts and humanities,
    Inform communities in times of crisis,
    Celebrate our state’s people, stories and culture.

## Productions

We create compelling original productions that reflect the rich diversity of North Carolina and its communities. From programs about travel, culture, public affairs, science, nature and the arts to innovative digital series and illuminating documentaries, we celebrate our state’s people and culture in thoughtful and surprising ways.
