Each year, WHYY further serves
the community through "off-air" programs such as community forums, artistic
performances and lectures onsite in the Independence Foundation Civic Space, and
Dorrance H. Hamilton Public Media Commons. Our strategic approach is to use on
air and online content to drive in-person audience engagement.
