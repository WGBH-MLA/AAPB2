## About

On May 6, 1961 the first signal from newly named WFCR (Four College
Radio (Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, and UMass Amherst) came from
a 10-watt transmitting site at Springfield Trade High School, under a license
held by GBH.

Over fifty years later, New England Public Radio's frequencies
WFCR and WNNZ are proud to serve over 165,000 weekly listeners throughout western
New England from Hartford, CT to Brattleboro, VT with music, news and entertainment
programs twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
