## About

With a history spanning five decades, the PBS NewsHour is consistently named the most trusted news program in the country and continues to earn some of journalism’s highest honors.  Co-anchored by Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff, the PBS NewsHour continues the journalistic legacy first set forth by Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer – who established the nightly news program’s mission of providing serious, long-form journalism to a nationwide audience.  PBS NewsHour reaches millions of viewers on PBS and via a [robust website](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/), multiple digital platforms and public radio in select markets.  NewsHour Productions LLC is a wholly-owned, non-profit subsidiary of WETA in Washington, DC.
