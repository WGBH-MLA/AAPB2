Iowa PBS is Iowa's statewide public broadcasting network. Iowa PBS provides quality, innovative media and services that educate, inform, enrich and inspire Iowans throughout the state.

A noncommercial, public-service mission enables Iowa PBS to present an unequaled array of programs of lasting value to Iowans regardless of where they live or what they can afford. Their educational media and resources help prepare Iowaâ€™s children for success in school and opens up the world to them in age-appropriate ways. Nearly half the households in the viewing area tune to Iowa PBS each month for programming that reflects a range of interests for Iowans in all demographic categories.
