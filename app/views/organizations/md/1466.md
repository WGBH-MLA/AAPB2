## History

Minnesota Public Radio is one of the nation's premier public radio
stations producing programming for radio, online and live audiences. MPR started
at Saint John’s University where Bill Kling, a student, found the support of Father
Colman Barry, President of Saint John’s, to launch a new college radio station.

KSJR went on air on January 22, 1967 as a 40,000-watt classical music FM station.
This single station grew into Minnesota Public Radio and a number of other public
media companies, collectively called the American Public Media Group. Today MPR
operates a 44-station radio network serving nearly all of Minnesota and parts
of surrounding states. Reaching 900,000 weekly listeners, MPR and its three regional
services—MPR News, Classical MPR and The Current—produce programming for radio,
online and live audiences.
