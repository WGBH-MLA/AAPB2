## About

Beginning as a tiny 10-watt station back in 1972, KEXP has grown
over the years into an innovative, influential cultural force in the Seattle community
and beyond. Some of the station's milestones include:

1972 -KCMU begins broadcasting
as a student-run station from a 10-watt transmitter at 90.5 FM atop McMahon Hall
on the University of Washington campus.

1981- UW budget cuts mean KCMU becomes
a community supported, listener powered station.

1982- Increased wattage (182-watts)
means listeners hear KCMU outside the University District for the first time.

1985-
KCMU forges the musical philosophy and programming focus that defines us today,
adding hip hop, roots, blues, contemporary global music, reggae, jazz, and more
to its lineup.

1986- KCMU moves to 90.3 FM, relocates its transmitter to Capitol
Hill, and boost its power to 400-watts so that listeners as far as 15 miles away
can pick up the signal.

championing local artists, venues, and record labels.

Bldg. (CMU) to Kane Hall.

Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, KCMU becomes KEXP 90.3 FM, moving to its first
high-tech studios. KEXP nearly doubles its wattage from 400 to 720, serving many
more people in the Puget Sound, and creates more ways for people across the world
to enjoy the KEXP experience. KEXP’s UW engineers develop radio’s first real-time
