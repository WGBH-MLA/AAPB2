## About

The Pacifica Foundation, founded by Lewis Hill in 1947, was given
the mission to create a new kind of radio, supported by listeners, owing nothing
to sponsors, providing an outlet for creative expression and a safe haven for
artistic experiments with the radio medium. Predating National Public Radio by
20 years and beginning in 1949 with KPFA-94.1 FM Berkeley, CA, the network added
four stations (WBAI 99.5 FM -NYC, KPFK 90.7 FM Los Angeles, WPFW 89.3 FM Washington
D.C., and KPFT 90.1 FM Houston, TX.), over the next 28 years. Perhaps best known
as a chronicler of social justice movements and cultural change, the Pacifica
stations also embrace the performing and literary arts, offering sometimes the
only forum for cutting edge and classical arts, and providing a stage to experiment
with radio drama, spoken word, sound sculpture, and the art of radio documentary.

The
Pacifica Radio Archives were established in 1971, beginning as a repository for
station programmers to deposit taped programs of exceptional historic value, appropriate
for rebroadcast by other stations, or as "archival source material" for radio
producers, artists, scholars, and others. The Archives contains over 100,000 program
units, 40,000 of which have descriptive records (available at pacificaradioarchives.org),
18,000 of which have been digitally preserved.  The programs date from the advent
of Pacifica Radio in 1949 through the present day, the bulk dated between 1955-1985
on the Â¼ inch reel-to-reel format.  This audio history documents the last half
of the 20th century and reflects the memory, traditions and evolution
of Pacifica Radio.

The intellectual content of the collection emphasizes a common
thread of social justice covering cultural, health, historical, political, psychological,
racial, religious, philosophical and social aspects of our society over a variety
of subjects. These include: the McCarthy era, architecture, film history, literature,
music, visual arts and culture, Asian- Americans, Indigenous Peoples of the Americas,
international affairs, Latin America, the Middle East, South Africa, U.S. intelligence,
war, peace, Jews in Europe and the U.S., science and health, women, civil liberties,
civil rights, authors in their own words, economics, media, and science. 

Arts programming
includes radio adaptations of classic plays and other literary works, original
radio dramas, readings of poetry and literature, programs hosted by authors and
poets, radio arts, discussions of literature, poetry, drama, sound sculpture,
and other genres hosted by artists. 

The Archives have been awarded several grants
for the digital preservation and improved description of this important collection
including grants from The Grammy Foundation, The Ford Foundation, The National
Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the California
Audio/Visual Preservation Project, and our largest grant currently in process
from the National Historical Records and Publications Commission.

The majority
of the collection resides in the temperature and humidity controlled vault at
the Pacifica Radio Archives office in North Hollywood, California.  Please contact
