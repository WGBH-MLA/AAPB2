## About

On May 1, 1988, after eight years of planning and work by an highly
dedicated group of volunteers, WERU began broadcasting at 89.9 FM from the top
of Blue Hill Mountain on the coast of Maine. Noel Paul Stookey (of Peter, Paul
and Mary fame) was the station's first benefactor and from whose converted chicken
coop, affectionately known as "The Henhouse," WERU first broadcast. 

In 1997
the station moved to its current location on U.S. Route 1 in East Orland, centrally
located in the middle of the radio station’s signal area. 

WERU is noncommercial
and independent, and from its inception it has been a grassroots, volunteer-powered
and listener-supported community radio service.

WERU offers over 50 genres of
music as well as a wide variety of national and local news, public affairs and
short spoken-word features.  Almost all of WERU’s local content is produced by
volunteers from the community. 

WERU is a member of the National Federation of
Community Broadcasters and Maine Association of Broadcasters.
