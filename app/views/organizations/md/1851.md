## About

South Carolina Educational Television began in the library of a high
school in 1958.  A teacher shortage in French and algebra was solved by sending
teachers via closed circuit television to other schools.  The circuits eventually
extended statewide, and into broadcast by 1963.  In 1972, the network expanded
again into public radio as a member of NPR.  Today, South Carolina ETV consists
of 11 TV transmitters and 8 radio transmitters carrying five different services
statewide.  Through ETV Streamline, ETV provides classroom content via the internet
with safe, standards-based curriculum.
