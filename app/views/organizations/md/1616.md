## About

KUT was established in 1958 and became a charter member of NPR in
1971, carrying the first-ever broadcast of All Things Considered in May of that
year. KUT also contributed the first of, what would become in time, 14 of the
station’s employees to the NPR staff. In 1979, KUT carried the November inaugural
broadcast of Morning Edition, with Bob Edwards as host and, in doing so, helped
to launch what has become one of the most important and honored public radio programs.
