## History

“Tonight you join me on a great adventure,” legendary newscaster Edward R. 
Murrow famously said as he introduced channel13, WNDT (“New Dimensions in 
Television”) during the station’s inaugural broadcast on September 16, 1962. 
With that flip of a switch, the greater New York region’s first public 
television station was born. In 1970, WNDT merged with producer National 
Educational Television (NET), eventually becoming WNET, parent company to 
public television stations THIRTEEN and WLIW21 and operator of NJTV. 


## Productions

With that historic first broadcast, the station offered a relevant 
alternative to the commercial networks that would set the gold standard for 
decades to come. Signature programming included:

The 1960s: New York Television Theater (1965), featuring noted actors as 
Sada Thompson and James Earl Jones; Dustin Hoffman’s TV debut in NET 
Playhouse: Journey of the Fifth Horse (1966); and for the first time on

Adams and his descendants; and Great Performances’ Dance in America was

entirely to dance (1976).

the animated children’s math series Cyberchase debut. Also in the 2000s,
