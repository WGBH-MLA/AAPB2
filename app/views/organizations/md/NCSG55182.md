## About

ITVS (Independent Television Service) was founded in 1988 through legislation by Congress to create content that enriches the cultural landscape with the voices and visions of underrepresented communities, and reflect the interests and concerns of a diverse society. ITVS documentaries have garnered countless Oscar nominations, Peabody awards, Emmys and du Pont awards for presenting their documentaries across public media. ITVS has also funded and produced films for more than 40 television hours per year on the PBS series POV, Frontline, American Masters, and American Experience, and short-form content for PBS and Independent Lens that has also appeared on YouTube and the PBS app. ITVS produces the Emmy-winning documentary series Independent Lens, which showcases independent filmmakers' non-fiction work and is distributed on PBS. 

ITVS programs are co-produced by other public media organizations like Center of Asian American Media, Firelight, Latino Public Broadcasting, and KQED, and is funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Acton Family Giving, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, The Park Foundation, and Wyncote Foundation. For more information, visit itvs.org.
