## About

KSLU 90.9 FM & HD is a CPB-qualified, non-commercial educational radio station in Hammond, Louisiana owned and operated by Southeastern Louisiana University. Many of the announcers are communication students at Southeastern training for careers in the broadcast industry. KSLU strives to serve both the Southeastern and surrounding communities.  

The station began operation in 1974 as a radio club at Southeastern Louisiana College (as it was known then) operating at ten watts of power. Initially, the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during the weekends and during the holidays. Thanks to support from the Student Government Association and self-assessed fees of the student body, in 1983 the station qualified for membership in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Since that time the station has increased power to 3,000 watts.

KSLU celebrated its 50th birthday on November 11, 2024.

The broadcast schedule offers a vast array of non-commercial programs which educate and entertain. KSLU offerings include local talk shows, news, sports, campus, and community activities. KSLU is the station in the local market playing album-oriented classic rock, blues, and Louisiana artists.
