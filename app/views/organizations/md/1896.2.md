## About

Wisconsin Public Radio is a 3-network, 34-startion regional group with a very long history.  Regular broadcasts began from our flagship station WHA (then the callsign was 9XM) before America's entry into World War I.  Our website has a nice list of our [accomplishments](http://www.wpr.org/wprs-tradition-innovation).

## Productions

Chapter A Day - one of the longest-running programs in radio
history, began on WHA when a radio guest cancels and the host decides to read
a library book to fill the hour. Listeners ask for more. In 1932, it's carried
as a summer program. In 1939, it becomes a daily program and continues to this
day. 

The Larry Meiller Show - a midday show full of practical tips, traces its
roots back to the earliest days of noontime weather and farm-market reports. 

Michael
Feldman's Whad'Ya Know? - one of WPR's shows that is distributed nationwide.  This
shows, offering music, humor, quizzes has been running for thirty years. 

To
the Best of Our Knowledge - another long-running WPR show that is distributed
to many other public radio stations. 

You can see a full list of our programs
under the "Shows" tab on any of our webpages. You'd be hard-pressed to find
another public radio organization producing as many shows.
