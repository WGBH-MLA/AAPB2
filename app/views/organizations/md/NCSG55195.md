## About

KTNA's mission is to enrich and connect the communities of the Upper Susitna Valley through informational and cultural programming.

Local residents began working to bring radio to the northern Susitna Valley for community enrichment in the 1980s, and Talkeetna Community Radio incorporated in July 1988. KTNA began broadcasting in January 1993 with 1000 watts from a small log cabin on Second Street in downtown Talkeetna.

Since then the station has evolved in many ways, becoming an essential resource for the community. KTNA began with a skeletal staff and many local volunteers and has evolved into a full-service community station where volunteers continue to be our core.

KTNA presents a wide variety of programming twenty-four hours every day, drawing from National Public Radio and other national and independent program distributors. Beyond national news and cultural programs, KTNA offers local news, educational and informative programming, music with local DJs, and continuous emergency broadcast capacity.
