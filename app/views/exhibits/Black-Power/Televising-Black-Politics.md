“Our Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white- separate and unequal."[<sup>1</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#1)


Televised images of the Civil Rights Movement have been ingrained into the US collective memory. Black people attacked by dogs, protestors assaulted at lunch counters, fire hoses turned on children -- non-violent protest and repressive violence garnered the sympathy of much of the nation. The fight for Southern Civil Rights, a response to the oppressive conditions of Jim Crow, was seen by the majority of US citizens as a regional issue and not of concern to the nation at large.[<sup>2</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#2) However, televised images helped to turn the tide on the Civil Rights Movement and garnered the support of Americans across the country.[<sup>3</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#3)

For example, Martin Luther King Jr. was well aware of the power of television and used cameras within his protest strategy at times cancelling events if he knew that the press would not be there.[<sup>4</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#4) These images compelled both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to intercede on behalf of the African American population and the violence and repression they experienced on a daily basis.[<sup>5</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#5)

On the other hand, the rising Black Power Movement--in its many forms, interpretations and practices-- a direct result of the protracted change in the US racial landscape, was generally met with fear from the mainstream public and misunderstanding from the majority of television news outlets. <table class="exhibit-image">

</table>The concurrent revolts that sparked in major cities across the US in the mid to late 1960s, for example, Watts (1965), Chicago (1966), and the uprisings during the “long hot summer” of 1967, only added to this climate of misunderstanding.  Yet the riots were the direct result of the racism, police brutality, limited opportunities and general lack of change that many organizations in both the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement sought to address.

In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the National Advisory Committee on Civil Disorders, often referred to as the Kerner Commission, to explore the cause of the riots and determine what could be done to prevent them from happening again.  The commission was specifically asked to explore the effects of the mass media on the riots. It judged riot reporting to be sensationalized and indicated that it “failed to analyze and report adequately on racial problems in the United States.”[<sup>6</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#6) They further argued that “media report and write from the standpoint of a white man’s world.”[<sup>7</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#7) The commission stated that the media did not explore the problems that Blacks faced in the country or even acknowledge Black history and culture. In considering the media’s role in contributing “to the black-white schism in this country,” the commission suggested the need for increased hiring of Blacks not only as news reporters, but also in positions of influence such as writers and editors.[<sup>8</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#8) 

Commercial network television producers largely ignored the recommendations of the Kerner Commission; in fact, many embraced the very tokenism that the report rejected.[<sup>9</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#9) In 1968, there were approximately 200 public television stations in the U.S.; yet African American subject matter was not a primary focus of their programming. However, the civil unrest that resulted from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, prompted many television organizations to revisit the recommendations of the Kerner Commission. An interesting example of the impact of the King assassination occurred with PBS affiliate WGBH in Boston. In an attempt to prevent possible disorder, Boston city officials negotiated with WGBH to televise a previously scheduled James Brown concert live on the day after Martin Luther King was assassinated.

Fans were encouraged to stay at home and watch the concert instead of attending the live event and city officials credit this decision with keeping peace in the city after the King assassination.[<sup>10</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#10) Soon thereafter, WGBH recognizing the impact of the Brown concert on the Black community, began the production of the Black public affairs program, *Say Brother* in a continued attempt to engage with the Black audience.

At the time of the uprisings in 1968, National Educational Television (NET) was more willing and more prepared than network television to distribute content that engaged with issues pertaining to Black America.  Under the banner of NET Journal, it had already aired “Midsummer 1967” (8/1967), an on location moderated conversation between the white and Black citizens of Newark, NJ about the conditions which led to the uprisings. [*NET Journal*](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-k35m90306x) concluded with an in-studio summary of the event. *NET Journal* also released “Where is Prejudice?” (11/12/1967) a multi-ethnic and multi-religious experiment which brought together African American, Asian American, Jewish, Catholic and Protestant students to discuss the question of prejudice in the country. The experiment elicited honest and sometimes disturbing responses from the participants. [INSERT EPISODE]  NET also had several other documentaries in production and released them in the weeks following King’s assassination.


*Civil Rights: What Next?* (4/11/68) was a moderated panel discussion between African American political leaders James Forman of the Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Hosea Williams of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Floyd McKissick of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) who were located in New York and white conservatives John Field of US Conference of Mayors, James Kilpatrick, a journalist from Virginia and Charles Mathias a Republican Congressman from Maryland located in Washington DC. The contentious conversation is an attempt to show different points of view on the causes of racism in the United States; however, the conversation is so argumentative that indeed at one point the producers cut off the microphones on the New York panel.  The discussion leads to no concrete solutions and the moderator concludes by saying, “I’m afraid the lesson of this hour is strongly that to expose racial problems in the United States in 1968 is to exacerbate them rather than to help solve them.” [*Civil Rights: What Next?*](/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-741rq0bx)

*Still a Brother: Inside the Negro Middle Class* (4/29/1968) was produced, edited and directed by African American filmmaker William Greaves.  Narrated by Ossie Davis, the documentary follows the lives of wealthy Black Americans from a variety of occupations , higher education, publishing, politics, who discuss their lives within primarily white circles. [Part 1](/catalog/cpb-aacip_516-kd1qf8kh4s)  Through imagery and interviews, the film contrasts their lives with those of working class Black people, some engaging in a discussion on the current state of Black affairs. [Part 2](/catalog/cpb-aacip_516-kd1qf8kh4s)/[Part 3](/catalog/cpb-aacip_516-kd1qf8kh4s) 

*Color Us Black* (5/6/1968) interrogates the conflicts at Howard University, which lead to the four-day occupation of the administration building.  The students discuss their dissatisfaction with their education which they see as molding them to imitate white society or to accept a place as second-class citizens. [*Color Us Black* Part 1](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/210745) They also contemplate  different ways of achieving Black liberation. The second half of the documentary was a fictional film created by Howard student Benjamin Land. [*Color Us Black* Part 2](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/210747) NET provided the technical equipment to create the film, which explores notions of Black identity in an interracial world. 

While *NET Journal* offered space for Black voices, filmmakers and subjects, the shows often sought to create a “balance” in perspectives for both a Black and white audience as suggested by the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine, “Midsummer 1967” and *Civil Rights: What Next?* are two such examples. In striving for this level of fairness, the shows provide little contextualization for the introduction of new viewpoints on Blackness.  For example, without a context for understanding why the leaders of SNCC ideologically separated from the SCLC during the era of Martin Luther King, the views of these young people may seem radical and thus dismissed without an attempt for understanding.  

The need for shows that were created from a Black perspective was essential if public television was to truly fulfill the mandate of the Kerner Commission and fully integrate African Americans into all aspects of news production.[<sup>11</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#11) Local public television stations established Black public affairs programs in major cities across the US, including *New Mood, New Breed* (Philadelphia), *Like it Is* (New York); *Colored People’s Time* renamed *American Black Journal* (Detroit), *Our People* (Chicago), *Minority Matters* (Kansas City) and *Harambee* (Washington DC). However, while public television stations were willing to target Black audiences, programming was created under the editorial control of established white producers. Black journalists, filmmakers and producers had to advocate in order to shift the control of these programs into the hands of African Americans.  

A few of these programs such as *Black Journal* (NET, New York) and *Soul!* (WNDT, New Jersey)[<sup>12</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#12) and the aforementioned *Say Brother* (WGBH, Boston) became national shows and were broadcast across a wide range of public television stations. The appearance of African American- produced public affairs programming at such a critical moment in US political history opened the door for a discussion of a variety of African American political viewpoints outside of the integrationist politics espoused by Civil Rights activists.

Since Stokely Carmichael had called for Black Power during his June 16, 1966, speech in Greenwood Mississippi, the concept of Black Power was largely misconstrued by mainstream media as radical and potentially dangerous.[<sup>13</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#13) African American produced public and cultural affairs programming gave voice to the changing political tide evident in the Black Power ethos of the time.  These shows expressed a variety of political viewpoints and were often not tethered to the FCC’s “Fairness Doctrine” that required television shows to exhibit a balanced view on controversial topics.  These producers, such as *Black Journal* 's William Greaves and Ellis Haizlip of *Soul!* believed that for far too long television had excluded Black viewpoints all together.  Black produced public affairs programs allowed for multiple perspectives on strategies for Black empowerment to be seen across national airwaves for the very first time in US history.
