Prior to the publication of the Kerner Commission report, in 1965 the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television conducted an extensive study on the role of noncommercial educational television on American airwaves. The Commission’s findings, Public Television, a Program for Action: The Report and Recommendations of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, listed a dozen recommendations for how to improve public television, which became the impetus for the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 and the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).[<sup>14</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#14) The very next year, in 1968, the Kerner Commission published its findings faulting commercial television for its discriminatory reporting on race-relations. Commercial television, specifically news programming, gave more airtime to the Civil Rights Movement and what they considered more temperate African Americans than the Black Power Movement and its leaders. Network news coverage of African Americans remained within a limited range of safe topics that either favored white sensibilities or triggered white fears of Black resistance and rebellion.

Black Power as a political ideology was often criticized and misinterpreted in network television news coverage.[<sup>15</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#15) Black Power organizations, activists, and ideals generally received unfavorable media coverage that depicted them as “violent, irrational, and threats to national security.”[<sup>16</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#16) Launched in 1953, public broadcasting was conceived of as an educational tool and an alternative to commercial networks. However, until the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the ensuing social unrest in 1968, the approximately 200 public television stations in the U.S. did not highlight African American subject matter.[<sup>17</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#17) Within months of King’s assassination, public television attempted to correct this error, and African Americans had unprecedented access to public television with local public television shows such as Boston’s Say Brother (1968-), Chicago’s For Blacks Only (1968-79), Detroit’s Colored People’s Time (1968-), and New York’s Like It Is (1968-). 

Black Journal, the first nationally televised public affairs program produced for, about, (and eventually) by African Americans, aired on June 12th, 1968. Produced by NET, the series began as a monthly newsmagazine style show on topical issues relevant to African Americans.  Alvin (Al) Perlmutter, an established white television producer, initiated the idea for Black Journal.  He was originally scheduled to make a documentary on the uprisings of 1968 for NET, but instead decided to transfer the funding into the first three episodes of Black Journal. With an initial budget of $100,000 per episode, Black Journal sought to provide a national audience with a diverse spectrum of African American stories, perspectives and political views. Believing that for far too long, television excluded African American voices and viewpoints, Black Journal and reported on issues or political figures thought to be too controversial for mainstream white audiences by commercial television producers. The series was an opportunity to provide a national audience a much more encompassing perspective of Black Power, Black nationalism and Black political thought.


### *Black Journal* and Shifting Control of Production

Initially, production for Black Journal was under the direction of executive producer Al Perlmutter, whose team included eleven African American and nine white staff members.[<sup>18</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#18) While NET advertised the program as created and controlled by African Americans, white producers held the positions of power, and developed the majority of the segments. Frustrated by their lack of editorial control, in August of 1968 the majority of the Black staff members went on strike demanding change.[<sup>19</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#19) Hoping to quickly resolve the issue, NET offered to remove the executive producer position altogether, arguing that an African American executive producer would have been hired, had they been able to find a qualified candidate. Instead, NET attempted to promote African American producer Lou Potter to “executive editor.” The staff initially accepted the offer, but quickly decided against it and demanded a Black executive producer for the program. They believed the show could only be true to its name and content if segments were actually created and produced by African Americans. Perlmutter was eventually replaced by William Greaves, producer, director, and occasional Black Journal cohost.
	
Greaves had extensive experience in documentary and nonfiction filmmaking. Due to limited opportunities for African Americans to learn and gain experience from U.S. film schools, Greaves worked as a filmmaker in Canada. He spent eight years training and working his way up from apprentice to assistant editor to sound editor, eventually becoming a writer and director for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).[<sup>20</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#20) While working for the NFB, Greaves learned to utilize documentary as a tool for social change.[<sup>21</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#21) Prior to his work on Black Journal, in collaboration with NET, Greaves directed the documentary Still a Brother (1968) about the Black middle class.[<sup>22</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#22) Once Greaves became the executive producer of Black Journal, he oversaw a predominantly African American production crew, providing the first opportunity for African Americans to produce their own content for a national television audience.

After the walkout, Black Journal not only boasted “a 75 percent black technical crew and a 95 percent black production crew,” but the show also trained minority staff members behind the scenes in production procedures.[<sup>23</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#23) The Black Journal Workshop was a free, hands-on, eight-week intensive program that was developed by director Peggy Pinn to train African Americans in production. Pinn hired well known industry professionals both white and black to run the workshops. Admission to the program was very competitive and students had to submit an essay on their career goals as part of the application process. The program was unable to accept all applicants, and many were denied entry into the program. Due to inconsistent funding and meager resources—for instance relying on borrowed equipment and facilities—the workshop had to shut down operations several times between 1968 and 1969. However, with an expanded $20,000 endowment from the CPB, the workshop was developed into a longer program that was able to teach students scriptwriting, cinematography, editing and directing.  The Black Journal Workshop graduated a pool of trained Black and Latinx students that were capable of being hired for Black Journal, as well as the film and television industry at large.[<sup>24</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#24) The Black Journal Workshop eventually moved under the management of the Public Broadcasting System ultimately becoming the National Educational Television Training School.[<sup>25</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#25) The workshop fulfilled one of the directives of the Kerner Commission report, the creation of educational and training opportunities for people of color to promote access into the media industry.[<sup>26</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#26) As a result of the Black Journal Workshop, the series had the largest number of trained, Black media professionals working in television.

The transfer of power from Al Perlmutter to William Greaves was immediately addressed in episode five of Black Journal, where host Lou House discusses the walkout and change of leadership. In producing Black Journal, Greaves compared the show to the “communal space of the black barbershop.”[<sup>27</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#27) During the weekly production meetings, he would perform a litmus test of sorts, where the proposed segments for the show had to be issues that directly addressed Black audiences. The imagined Black community was the basis of Greaves’ barbershop metaphor and his attempt to create a separate, distinct and communal space for African American viewers.[<sup>28</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#28) Greaves’ work as an accomplished and experienced filmmaker, allowed him to produce segments of Black Journal as experimental documentary. Episodes would feature both long and short-form documentary segments, usually shot abroad or on location, and observational pieces, where the camera slowly panned across locations or documented people in different locales without excessive editing. [INSERT CLIP] Not only is Black Journal a part of the history of public television, but the show should also be considered a part of the history of experimental documentary film.[<sup>29</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#29) Under William Greaves, Black Journal earned an Emmy Award in 1969 for excellence in public affairs programming.


### *Black Journal*: Imaging the Black Community

Black Journal aimed to provide audiences with a collective image of a national and international Black community that transcended regional, political, and generational differences.[<sup>30</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#30) At a national level, the series set the stage for the imagining of a Black nation and Black consciousness. In the pilot episode, host Lou House states in his introduction, “This is Black Journal, program number 1. It is our aim in the next hour, and in the coming months, to report and review the events, the dreams, the dilemmas of Black America and Black Americans.” The early years of Black Journal are noticeably inspired by the aesthetics of the Black Power era.  For example, the desire to connect with one’s African roots is reflected in the map of Africa in the background of the set, which is decorated with indigenous relics. As hosts, House and Greaves sport Afros and are dressed in dashiki shirts. They introduced their audiences to culturally specific clothing of the time such as kente cloth, as well as the hairstyles, and terminology of the period.  Lou House would even greet viewers with a Black Power fist and a variation of the greeting, “Good evening. Jambo, A Salaam Alaikum brothers and sisters and welcome to Black Journal,” [INSERT CLIP] House’s greeting not only addressed Black Americans, but also Black Muslims internationally.

The show aimed to present multi-faceted and varied perspectives on the issues and concerns of Black Americans. Using short documentaries, in depth interviews and panel discussions, the show covered topics common to African Americans around the country, such as Black activism, school bussing, police brutality, the Black church, and voting rights.  However, Black Journal also travelled outside of the studio and to different regions of the country with significant African American populations, filming on location in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and Los Angeles.  Episodes titled “Black Compton” or “Black Chicago’ demonstrated the diversity of Black life in America. [INSERT CLIP] “Black Compton,” for instance depicts the frustrations of a city, whose citizens demanded improved municipal services, insurance for businesses and homeowners, and more economic opportunities. The Black Journal coverage of such cities demonstrated to Black audiences that certain racial and economic struggles were not isolated to just one or two cities, but in fact were shared by African Americans around the country. Regional representations of African Americans celebrated the shared characteristics of Black America, while simultaneously underscoring the diversity of Black life. 

Black Journal did not limit its definition of the Black community and a Black nation to U.S. borders. The show also explored diasporic Blackness, relating issues and struggles of Black people in America to the African diaspora. Propelled by William Greaves, Black Journal’s coverage of Africa was a response to the Black Power Movement’s embrace of global Blackness, in terms of personal and cultural identification as well as the political influence of Third World liberation movements. The show provided in-depth news reporting on Africa at a time when on location filming was difficult and costly. Segments on African countries provided a broadened context for defining Blackness in terms of culture, politics, and entertainment.[<sup>31</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#31) For example, in episode sixteen, Black Journal travels to the Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers, where activists from America and different African countries gather, including Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely Carmichael. [INSERT CLIP] In episode twenty-one, producer Kent Garrett took a film crew to Ethiopia to explore the country’s history, architecture, religion and culture. [INSERT CLIP] The second season of Black Journal grew progressively more transnational with several segments on African nations, including a segment on Ethiopian Airlines and African Liberation Day. Diasporic Blackness was important to Black Journal producers, who wanted audiences to understand that “people of African descent should embrace their shared histories of oppression and of liberation struggles.”[<sup>32</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#32) In 1970, Black Journal started a bureau in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia providing the production team with a base in Africa.[<sup>33</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#33)  


### *Black Journal* and Black Power Politics

Black Journal also directly delved into the meanings of Black Power by featuring known political leaders of the time such as Black Panther Party (BPP) co-founder Huey P. Newton, author-activist Stokely Carmichael, Kathleen Cleaver, Communications Secretary of the BPP, artist-activist Amiri Baraka, and NOI leader Elijah Muhammad. [INSERT CLIP]  Indeed the pilot episode of Black Journal, which includes memorable moments such as recently widowed Coretta Scott King who addresses the Harvard graduating class of 1968, also features an interview with Huey P. Newton from jail.  The decision to feature Newton --who was at the time facing murder charges—in the pilot episode demonstrates Black Journal’s willingness to challenge mainstream definitions and constructions of Black political ideology.[<sup>34</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#34) Black Journal provided a national audience, of both Black and white viewers, with an alternative view of the Black Panther Party and what they stood for, the importance of which cannot be understated given the mainstream depiction of the Black Panther Party as domestic terrorists. In the New York Times, Director of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover had deemed the BPP a hate group that represented “the greatest threat to internal security of the country.”[<sup>35</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#35) He suggested that “(l)eaders and representatives of the Black Panther Party travel extensively all over the United States preaching their gospel of hate and violence.”[<sup>36</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#36) 

Members of the Black Panther Party, as well as segments about the organization, were a regular feature on early episodes of Black Journal. In concert with stories on the NOI, Malcolm X and Amiri Baraka for example, this type of coverage is evidence of the political nature of the reporting and the rejection of the naïve concept of objectivity set forth by the Fairness Doctrine. Episode seven which aired in December 1968, Black Journal brought together a diverse panel of Black public figures, including Kathleen Cleaver, Andrew Young (SCLC), Alexander Allen (Urban League) and Dan Watts, editor Liberator magazine, to reflect on 1968 and offer their thoughts on the future of African Americans in the political arena. [INSERT CLIP] 
 
The series also provided favorable and in-depth coverage of the NOI. Episode seven in particular features NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, in his first extensive interview on television.[<sup>37</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#37) [INSERT CLIP] Prior to Black Journal’s coverage, the most well-known footage of NOI came from The Hate That Hate Produced (1959), a five-part television documentary produced by news journalists Mike Wallace and Louis Lomax, of WNTA-TV-New York.  As evident in the very title of the series the journalists presented one-sided and inflammatory assertions about the NOI and Black Nationalism  In April 1970, in episode 23, Black Journal traveled to Chicago to do a segment on the NOI’s various community-building initiatives such as an elementary school and the NOI newspaper Muhammad Speaks. [INSERT CLIP] Black Journal’s coverage of the NOI directly opposes some of the misinformation and myths about the organization.


### *Black Journal*: Funding and The Active Black Audience

Shortly after Black Journal received an Emmy, William Greaves left the show to focus on creating content for his own production company. The Greaves era (episodes 4-24) of Black Journal was followed by Tony Brown, who became both the executive producer and the program host in 1970. Brown, at the time president of the National Association of Black Media Producers, was much more publicly outspoken than Greaves and had a reputation as a critic of the media. He challenged the broadcasting licenses of several radio and television stations in cities like Atlanta, Cleveland, and Detroit.[<sup>38</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#38) Episodes under Tony Brown’s direction are immediately distinguished visually with a new opening theme that featured a red circle with images inside that formed the shape of the African continent. In episode 25, which aired in September 1970, Brown acknowledges the transfer from Greaves to himself, as well as the changes in the look and format of the show, stating however, “Our commitment to projecting a realistic picture of the Black experience is the same.” [INSERT CLIP]  

Brown made Black Journal his own by hiring new staff members, changing the set design, implementing new visual techniques and segments such as fake commercials or filmed end credits.  The focus of the series also shifted towards popular culture and media criticism. For example, Brown’s first episode included a segment on the lack of employment opportunities for African Americans in the media, featuring the actor Ossie Davis, the director Melvin Van Peebles, and William Greaves.  Other Brown produced episodes spotlighted Sweetsweetback’s Baadasssss Song (Van Peebles, 1971), the novel Pimp: The Story of my Life by Iceberg Slim (Robert Beck) and Sammy Davis, Jr.

By the time Brown took over Black Journal, the budget had significantly decreased, forcing him to cut costs in terms of staffing, length of the show, and location shooting. Beginning in October 1971, the format varied as the show switched from an hour to a half-hour broadcast that primarily dealt with one issue per week. Financial uncertainty was a constant struggle for the show’s production team. Although Black Journal was initially funded through the Ford Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting provided the remainder of the show’s budget during the first year. In its second year, the Black Journal budget was cut nearly eighty percent, forcing the show to air reruns. Black Journal’s resources and funding continued to decline. In December 1972, the CPB released the list of programs it intended to fund for the 1973-1974 season, and Black Journal, along with other Black focused programming such as Soul!, were not listed.[<sup>39</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#39) In 1973, the Ford Foundation also decided to stop funding television programming, therefore leaving Black Journal without private or government funding.
	
Producers turned to the Black press to appeal to audiences to support the series and challenge the CPB to bring back Black Journal for an additional season. Articles urging fan support appeared in national Black periodicals such as Jet and Ebony, as well as local Black newspapers in Chicago and Milwaukee.[<sup>40</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#40) Protests came from multiple organizations and supporters of Black Journal including the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Newspaper Publishers Association and a new group called The Friends of Black Journal. Some groups even went so far as to picket the CPB headquarters in Washington D.C. In February 1973, the CPB announced that Black Journal’s funding would be renewed for the 1973-1974 season. However, without the Ford Foundation funding, Black Journal was left with a significant budget deficit. While it returned to a one-hour format, there was only enough funding to produce approximately one third of its usual programming. The show was also limited to in-studio segments thus severely limiting on location documentary coverage.[<sup>41</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#41) 



### *Black Journal* and Commercial Television

The hard-fought efforts of audiences, Tony Brown and the program’s staff secured Black Journal funding and helped to keep the series on the air a bit longer.  However, syndication issues with local affiliate stations and their ability to reject specific episodes or entire seasons, made it difficult for Black Journal to compete with other less controversial public affairs programming such as Black Perspective on the News another Black public affairs’ show that covered more mainstream news stories. For example, many affiliates refused to program a Black Journal episode, which focused on the case of Angela Davis and the lives of Black prisoners.  In 1972, “only a quarter of PBS’s 139 stations chose to carry Black Journal, while the vast majority carried Black Perspective on the News.”[<sup>42</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#42) The following year, Black Perspective on the News surpassed Black Journal in terms of national distribution.[<sup>43</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#43) Eventually Black Journal left public television, transitioning to Tony Brown’s Journal on commercial television in 1977.[<sup>44</sup>](/exhibits/black-power/notes#44)  

Despite the conservative political shift and changes in funding distribution on public television, Black Journal as a cultural space was a site of Black resistance to mainstream misunderstandings and misinterpretations of Black cultural expression and political activism. Especially in its first three seasons, Black Journal maintained the highest level of cultural, political, and artistic significance. As the first national Black-produced and focused series in a white-dominated televisual landscape, Black Journal provided nuanced representations of Black people that extended beyond U.S. borders and connected Black life in America to the African diaspora. Most importantly, Black Journal provided a forum that allowed Black people to articulate a nuanced vision of Black society. 









Local communities have been leaders in the initiative to preserve perspectives often marginalized within the broad story of American history. A 1997 episode of [*Open Air*](/catalog/cpb-aacip_60-75r7t0n4) from Mississippi Public Broadcasting drew attention to the grassroots efforts that led to the designation of Farish Street as an African-American historic district at the state and federal level, while a 2011 episode of [*Connections*](/catalog/cpb-aacip_41-225b0636) from South Carolina Educational Television gave a platform for little-known African American historic sites in South Carolina. Such efforts illustrate how local communities are working to save and interpret the sites they encounter on a daily basis.
