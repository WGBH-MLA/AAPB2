## Main

*Frontline*'s 1986 program “AIDS: A National Inquiry,” examined in the previous section of this exhibit, was one of the first of many approaches to the epidemic produced for national distribution. While some of these materials are not available in the AAPB Online Reading Room, many can be accessed on-site at the Library of Congress and at GBH, and others are available online elsewhere.

Three nationally distributed public radio series in the AAPB collection have broadcast more than thirty programs on HIV/AIDS: In Black America from KUT Radio in Austin, Texas; the Spanish-language public radio series *Línea Abierta*, broadcast on the Radio Bilingüe network; and *Outcasting*, syndicated on Pacifica and PRX.

### [*In the Life*](/special_collections/ucla-inthelife)

This monthly series of half-hour programs broadcast between 1992 and 2012, television’s first and longest-running LGBTQ+ news magazine, featured newsmagazine segments on a variety of topics including LGBTQ+ life, politics, arts, history, activism, health, religion, race, rights, and sports. The series was presented by WNYC until 1996 and by WNET after that. PBS did not distribute the series, but after an effort by series producers and staff to promote it to station managers throughout the U.S., by 2005, it was airing on 125 stations in 30 states. Regarding coverage by the series of the AIDS epidemic, media historian Stephen Tropiano writes:
> One of the show’s most important and lasting contributions was its ongoing coverage of the HIV/AIDS, particularly when the media no longer considered the disease “front-page news.”  In December 1996, an episode entitled [“The State of AIDS”](/catalog/cpb-aacip-b3a9f15d7ba) featured segments on protease inhibitors, and profiles of AIDS activist Michelle Lopez and composer John Corigliano, whose “Symphony #1” was inspired by the AIDS crisis. Four years later, in recognition of World AIDS Day, [“AIDS is Still a Big Deal”](/catalog/cpb-aacip-afb5402a066) (Episode #1803) featured stories on high-risk behavior among HIV+ young gay men, discrimination in the workplace, and an on-camera discussion on the current state of the pandemic featuring Dr. Mathilde Krim, founding chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR). In 2010, [“The Cost of Stigma”](/catalog/cpb-aacip-d945517440d) (Episode #2003) offered an in-depth look at how fear and misinformation are at the root of the criminalization of HIV transmission. These and the many other AIDS-related episodes and segments that aired throughout the show’s 20-year run served as a painful, yet much needed reminder that the AIDS crisis was far from over.[<sup>126</sup>](/exhibits/hiv-aids-and-public-broadcasting/notes#126)

### *POV*

Since 1988, PBS has aired more than 500 independent nonfiction films as part of its series POV, an abbreviation used by filmmakers for “point of view.” The series has provided intimate views of various areas of society, including nine documentaries about the lived experiences of people with HIV/AIDS. POV’s goal is “to provide a platform for voices not present elsewhere on television and in this society.”  In addition to documenting the disease itself, the films explored issues of race, poverty, homophobia, faith, mortality, and grief, and they helped humanize those affected by AIDS.  

Though most of the films about AIDS followed subjects in the United States, one documentary, *State of Denial* (dir. Elaine Epstein, 2003), covered the AIDS pandemic in South Africa and will be discussed in a later section about AIDS in Africa. 

[***Living with AIDS***](/catalog/cpb-aacip-7d3448f8cd2) **(dir. Tina DiFeliciantonio, 1987; broadcast on *POV*, July 19, 1988)**

Follows Todd Coleman, a 22-year-old gay man, and his caretakers during the last few weeks of his life.

[***Absolutely Positive***](/catalog/cpb-aacip_55-cf9j38kt93) **(dir. Peter Adair, 1991; broadcast on ***POV***, June 18, 1991)** 

*Absolutely Positive* conveys the experiences of twelve HIV-positive people, covering how they contracted it, what it felt like to find out, and the emotional effects of their positive status on their friends, partners, and family members. The documentary consists almost entirely of interviews with director Peter Adair, who also provides narration about the disease as well as about himself and the subjects. He contemplates their outlooks on life and how they came to terms with the disease.  

[***Tongues Untied***](/catalog/cpb-aacip-50c989be918) **(dir. Marlon Riggs, 1989; broadcast on ***POV***, July 16, 1991)**    

Emmy Award-winning writer and director Marlon Riggs emphasized themes of Blackness, sexuality, and art in his work. In Tongues Untied, he used “dance, music, poetry to passionately tell his compelling story of searching for acceptance in a society with racist whites who stigmatize him for being black, and antigay blacks who stigmatize him for being gay,” B. J. Bullert, author of a study on documentaries airing on public television, has written. [<sup>127</sup>](/exhibits/hiv-aids-and-public-broadcasting/notes#127) *Tongues Untied* proved controversial for programmers and station managers, who had to weigh the risk of airing content considered obscene by some, against *POV*’s mission to deliver unorthodox views to the public.  

[***Silverlake Life: The View from Here***](/catalog/cpb-aacip-41-22v41rq7) **(dir. Tom Joslin and Peter Friedman, 1993; broadcast on ***POV***, June 15, 1993)**

The uniqueness of *Silverlake Life* comes from Tom Joslin’s choice to act as both the director of the film and one of the main subjects. He and his partner, Mark Massi, battled AIDS together and provided support for one another after their diagnoses. Joslin shot much of the film at their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silverlake in a video diary style, and as a result, it contained extremely personal imagery and focused on the couple’s romantic relationship as they experienced both challenges and moments of happiness from one day to the next. Joslin died before he could complete the project and left the footage to filmmaker Peter Friedman, a former student of Joslin’s, who made the final film. Ten years later, Friedman made an [epilogue](/catalog/cpb-aacip-41472412366) to Silverlake Life after Massi also had passed away. 

The year before *Silverlake Life*, Friedman produced a 28-minute documentary about an HIV-positive man titled [*Fighting in Southwest Louisiana*](/catalog/cpb-aacip-022be8c989c), which aired over public broadcasting stations, but gained less visibility when Friedman released *Silverlake Life* shortly afterwards.

[***The Heart of the Matter***](/catalog/cpb-aacip-44b4cc0ff45) **(dir. Amber Hollibaugh and Gini Reticker, 1994; broadcast on ***POV***, July 12, 1994)**

According to producer Amber Hollibaugh, *The Heart of the Matter* is “not a film about HIV. It’s a film about women.” The film followed the story of Janice Jirau, an HIV-positive Black woman, and the comfort she found through the women in her life and her religious community. It also grappled with broader issues of stigma and discussed how women with AIDS did not receive very much visibility, support, or education in the areas of safe sex and HIV/AIDS. 

[***The Transformation***](https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/181617) **(dir. Carlos Aparicio and Susana Aiken, 1996; broadcast on ***POV***, July 9, 1996)**

Ricardo, the film’s main subject, previously lived as a gay man and a transgender woman. He renounced both of these identities after finding out his HIV-positive status. A Christian man took him in from the streets, and Ricardo’s faith strengthened. He married a woman and lived as a straight man for the rest of his life. At the end of the documentary, however, Ricardo stated that if he could still choose, he would choose to be a woman. 

***The Smith Family*** **(dir. Tasha Oldham, 2002; broadcast on *POV*, June 25, 2002)**

A documentary about a Mormon family grappling with two HIV-positive parents.

***State of Denial*** **(dir. Elaine Epstein, 2003; broadcast on ***POV***, September 16, 2003)**

Examines the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa, which had the highest number of people living with HIV in the world. See [Public Broadcasting Covers the HIV/Aids Pandemic in Africa](/exhibits/hiv-aids-and-public-broadcasting/5-public-broadcasting-covers-the-hiv-aids-pandemic-in-africa).

[***Memories of a Penitent Heart***](https://web-windows.tubitv.com/movies/595668/memories-of-a-penitent-heart) **(dir. Cecilia Aldarondo, 2016; broadcast on ***POV***, July 31, 2017)** 

Cecilia Aldarondo decided to pursue the project out of curiosity about her uncle, who died of AIDS when she was young. She tracked down his partner and, upon finding and interviewing him, discovered the homophobia they experienced from Aldarondo’s religious family. She also looked for answers regarding her uncle’s complex choice to repent for his homosexuality before his death. Much of the film was comprised of interviews as well as Aldarondo’s narration as she processed the information that surfaced throughout the film.

[“Latino Communities Need More AIDS Prevention Programs”](/catalog/cpb-aacip-392e07cf719) **(Radio Bilingüe, July 13, 1998)**

The director of the Committee for Hispanic Children and Families, Elba Montalbo, participated in the 12th World AIDS Conference, which recently had taken place in Geneva. Ms. Montalbo talked about the main concerns presented by Third World researchers and activists, as well as by people who work in poor neighborhoods and rural areas in the U.S. She related that new treatments are not being made available for low-income people and that most of the money available for research is focused on treatment, while prevention programs that are effective are not receiving enough funding. 

[**“Mexico Edition”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-7940afddd04) **(Radio Bilingüe, August 20, 1998)**
This episode of the "Voz Publica" series, with comments from Mexican listeners on current events, includes an interview about AIDS with Dr. Carmen Feliciano-Biuda de Melesio from the Department of Health in Puerto Rico.

[**“AIDS in Mexico: A Backlash”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-031522a0482) **(Radio Bilingüe, September 21, 1998)**

The legislature of Michoacan, a state in Western Mexico with a large migrant population, passed a bill penalizing with up to three years in prison the intentional transmission of HIV. Michoacan became the first state in the nation in penalizing transmission of HIV. The leaders of the initiative pointed to the staggering figure of AIDS deaths: 730 since 1985. Opponents noted the legal problem of proving intentions and also the lack of access to health care and education for people at risk of HIV infection. This roundtable featured Congressman Santiago Padilla, president of the Health Commission of Mexican Congress; Rep, Agustin Trujillo, from Michoacan's State legislature; Jorge Saavedra, advisor on AIDS issues for Mexico's federal Health Department, and Jorge Huerdo, ex-coordinator of the National Front of HIV-infected People. 

[**“AIDS and Public Health in Michoacan, Mexico”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-05ca60d0b67) **(Radio Bilingüe, November 10, 1998)**

The state of Michoacan is known for the large number of migrant workers it provides to the United States. As a consequence of this migration, there is a large number of people infected with HIV who cross the border. Maria Fincher, general manager of KBBF, in Santa Rosa, CA, presents an interview with the head of Michoacan's AIDS Commission discussing efforts to control the rapid increase of the epidemic in the state and to help HIV positive people and those with full-blown AIDS to overcome the solitude and lack of support they face due to the fear of local residents.

[**“AIDS and Faith”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-f303b8e823e) **(Radio Bilingüe, December 3, 1999)**

Practitioners from diverse faiths, AIDS chaplains in hospitals and prisons, public health professionals, and HIV-infected patients met in San Francisco on World AIDS Day. The conference entitled "A Call to Oneness" sought to open dialogue among people from diverse cultures and faiths to halt the AIDS epidemic using religious and spiritual traditions and support networks. 

[**“Health Edition – AIDS”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-6b60c129fa3) **(Radio Bilingüe, July 10, 2000)** 

Dr. Elmer Huerta commented that the AIDS virus has killed 19 million people worldwide, up from 16.3 million at the end of 1998. The disease, he said, is expected to wipe out half the teen-agers in some African nations. He explained the need for government leaders to face the problem head on. Listeners called in with questions about health and wellness.

[**“The AIDS Corridor”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-7163eadf0fb) **(Radio Bilingüe, December 4, 2000)**

The AIDS epidemic continues on the rise in the Latino community. Latinas are the hardest hit. On the occasion of World AIDS Day, this program revisited the plight of communities in western Mexico. Sergio Hugo Palma, President, Michoacanos Unidos por Salud y Contra el SIDA, stated that Michoacan is the fifth state in HIV prevalence, with more than 2,000 infected patients, many of them prisoners and military men, and 80% with migrant background. Guadalupe Gomez, Health Promoter, Michoacanos Unidos por Salud y Contra el Sida, told us that women get infected by their migrant husbands and face stigma, rejection, and persecution. Also, unsafe needles in Mexico and unsafe youth sex in the Caribbean are reportedly propelling an epidemic in those areas. This was a special report.

[**“AIDS: Twenty Years in the U.S.”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-58f038e7ffe) **(Radio Bilingüe, June 4, 2001)**

Twenty years ago this week, a government health agency gave the first warning of a rare disease in the U.S. The illness became known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and has taken the lives of more than 430,000 in the nation. This program looked into the impact of the epidemic among Latinos and current concerns about AIDS. Guests: Dr. Norman Hearst, University of California, San Francisco, National Hispanic Medical Association; Jorge Sandoval, Health Educator, AIDS Service Center. Brenda and Alejandro, two zero-positive patients from Los Angeles who were infected during the 90s, tell their experience living with HIV.

[**“HIV/AIDS Prevention”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-ed9375eb1d6) **(Radio Bilingüe, August 7, 2002)**
Many young Latinos are not heeding warnings on the risks of HIV/AIDS infection, and the epidemic threatens the youth and women. The rate of new cases is growing among these populations. This program, aired in collaboration with the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, focused on preventive measures and testing for HIV. Guest: Antonia M. Villarruel, Ph.D., director of Center for Health Promotion and associate professor at University of Michigan, www.hispanichealth.org. CALLS & COMMENTS: Six calls. Maria de Jesus (Toppenish) pointed to the need of investing in more outreach and education among migrants and the youth. Gabriel (Sunnyside): Few movies encourage safe sex; and condoms distributed by health agencies to the poor are usually of poor quality and thick and few people use them. Antonio (Modesto) shared the experience of a friend who infected his wife back in Mexico. Victor (Blythe): A woman friend in Tijuana has knowingly infected other men - is that a punishable crime? Javier (Visalia): The youth are not heeding the prevention message because they haven't seen people dying of AIDS like in the 80s, there are medicines that help HIV patients survive, and there are suicidal individuals who don't care.

[**“Health Edition – AIDS Day”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-976bd318100) **(Radio Bilingüe, December 2, 2002)**

On the day after World AIDS Day, this program looked into the pandemic and revisits studies on the AIDS corridor in migrant communities along the Pacific Coast.

This program also examines public efforts to give affected populations access to information and free AIDS tests. Guests: Maria Teresa Hernandez, Epidemiologist, University of California, California Mexico AIDS Initiative, University-wide AIDS Research Project, San Francisco, CA; Dr. Juan Ruiz, Acting Chief, HIV/AIDS Epidemiology, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, CA; “Yolanda,” homemaker, AIDS patient.

Jose in Grandview, WA, says condoms are just like a Russian roulette: they kill 20% of the times. Juan, Watsonville: HIV/AIDS is good business (the golden eggs’ hen) – a cure and vaccine could be found but is not in the interest of researchers and health educators.

[**“AIDS and Migrants”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-db40dd5ee0d) **(Radio Bilingüe, June 20, 2005)**

Concerned by the rising numbers of migrants infected with HIV/AIDS, academic researchers and health agencies conducted a survey in 2004 targeting migrants in Mexico and California.

[**“AIDS Spending”**](/catalog/cpb-aacip-e4c2ff9884d) **(Radio Bilingüe, June 12, 2007)**

The Bush administration announced they want to double the funding to fight AIDS to 30 billion for the next five years. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief still needs to be reauthorized by Congress. Some critics say the plan falls short of the goal to treat the 12 million people who may need antiviral drugs.

### *OutCasting*

Created in 2011 by and for LGBTQ youth and straight allies, *OutCasting* is intended for a general listening audience that is open to learning about LGBTQ issues but may not know much about them. Episodes deal in depth with marriage equality, gender identity, relationships with family and community members, media representation of LGBTQ people, challenges faced by trans people in sports, the legacy of Stonewall, what makes someone's voice stereotypically gay, intersex, transitioning, coming out, religion, politics, families, homophobia, transphobia, LGBTQ visibility, and histories of the LGBTQ community. Originally a local program in New York’s Hudson Valley, the show later became syndicated nationally on Pacifica and PRX. The following episodes focus on AIDS-related issues:
