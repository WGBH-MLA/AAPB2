<a name="11"></a><sup>11</sup> "The edge of America, the home of the homeless" is how Shearer often described his location in Santa Monica. 

<a name="12"></a><sup>12</sup> Shearer marked *Le Show*’s 1989 debut on Chicago AM superstation WGN in classic fashion: "It's been a long time, ladies and gentlemen, I have to be honest with you, since I've been nervous before a radio program – maybe the Jack Benny show in 1955, I don't know. I didn't keep track then. But I did have just a slight twinge driving to the *Le Show*-atorium today because we've been announcing – we? me – I've been announcing a lot of additional stations to the ever-growing but until this week still tiny *Le Show* network. But this week I think I can't say that anymore 'cause we've just added our first 50,000-watt AM radio affiliate, WGN in Chicago. Colonel McCormick is spinning in his grave right about now, I would say…. But it’s such a thrill to be on the same, for the first time, to be on the same radio station as Paul Harvey. It’s true." https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-81faa682ed3?proxy_start_time=680.743121.

<a name="35"></a><sup>35</sup> *Ethopoeia* is a rhetorical art dating back at least to Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle in the Lyceum in 322 B.C.E.

<a name="36"></a><sup>36</sup> "Ladies and gentlemen, as much as I was bewitched and besotted by comedy at an early age, I was also fascinated and seduced by journalism. I can remember at age 5, or whenever it was my parents first trusted me with blunt little scissors, cutting out and collecting the mastheads for all the different sections of the two daily papers we subscribed to, the main criterion for which was whichever papers in L.A. were still publishing and weren't the *Times*. When my moment came to be interviewed on TV by Art Linkletter, I confessed to my habit of making my parents take me to the out of town newsstand in Hollywood whenever possible, and for years our mailbox was filled with dailies from Fergus Falls, Minn., and other far-flung locales."

<a name="54"></a><sup>54</sup> Shearer's delivery of the phrase "*around* the world" exemplifies the rhetorical figure of diastole, a lengthening of the second vowel sound in "*around*" accompanied by an increase in volume to provide listeners with a synesthetic experience of the program circumnavigating the globe. An example comes early in this episode: https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-68cbe190b3d. On *diastole* see Richard Lanham, *Handlist of Rhetorical Terms*, 182. Shearer's diastole operates in his news announcer and radio promoter voices more generally, as in his habitual sign-off to the "News of the Olympic Movement": "… because it's a movement, and we all need one … every day!" An example is at *Le Show*, July 29, 1988, https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-a19d99d1cc2?start=677.1&end=692.74. 

<a name="55"></a><sup>55</sup> Repetition of the word "shortwave" seems to have been prompted by Shearer pronouncing "megahertz" and being reminded of longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' announcer Vin Scully's characteristic vowels; Shearer's Scully voices the redundant "shortwave" at 0:56:47.
