Using as backdrop music from the anthem of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ["Let Us Try" became a regular *Le Show* segment](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-798b2078b65?start=2205.21&end=2350.45) after Shearer started doing research for his documentary *The Big Uneasy*.

Other environmental segments that Shearer has presented on *Le Show* over the decades include "[News of Our Friend the Atom](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-89498abe4f5?start=826.54&end=1114.01)," focusing on nuclear power plant accidents and the problem of spent fuel storage, with Shearer voicing "Atty the Atom" for several years.

["News of the Warm"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-c5205cee5fe?start=1917.51&end=2074.2)

["News of Bees"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-bc88e87437c?start=258.92&end=704.15)

["News of Birds and Bees"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-7e03a531cca?start=626.23&end=876.73)

["Dominion"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-e7947c92944?start=1673.14&end=2071.59)

["News of Microplastics"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-f4b07301409?start=990.22&end=1384.67), the bumper music introduction to which displays Shearer's talent for sampling and remixing. Here he overdubs dialogue from the soundtrack of the 1967 *film The Graduate* to include the line, "I want to say just one word to you, just one word … microplastics," before concluding with music from Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel's song "Mrs. Robinson" as a sonic bed for reading the news.
