# Part 3: Navigating Racism

3

## Summary

Navigating the terrain of racism in New Mexico is no easy task. While racism often has been overlooked, ignored, or denied in communities, New Mexico public media stations have been sharing critical conversations about racism for decades.  

The *Witnessing New Mexico* Collection provides a critical exploration of communities of peoples who have survived and thrived despite persistent racial and class-based injustices. The content presented here highlights recent and past discussions about racism in an effort to inspire critical questioning of where the state of New Mexico and the nation are headed in terms of enacting racial equity.  

>"A new dialogue and debate is being heard over the fact that people of color are most often the most directly and severely impacted by pollution, toxic dumping, and often by the negative impacts of the mainstream environmental movement itself." — Marcos Martinez, *Environment, Race, and Class: The Poisoning of Communities of Color* (Part 1)
