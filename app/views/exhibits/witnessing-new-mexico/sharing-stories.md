# Part 2: Sharing Stories

2

## Summary

Sharing stories of people and their contributions to New Mexico can become acts of resistance. From presenting New Mexicans learning about their crypto-Jewish heritage to oral stories and artistic explorations of communities outside the mainstream, the programs in this section focus on stories that have been integral in our society, though often overlooked. 

Empowering people who have been labeled different or unimportant is a major feature of this collection. This section presents stories from influential and unknown women, people who are incarcerated, people with intellectual and developmental (dis)abilities, LGBTQIA youth, veterans of the infamous Bataan Death March, and women nurses who treated soldiers during the Vietnam War. These programs challenge expectations. Collectively, they present a dynamic and expansive picture of New Mexican politics, culture, and history.

"*Genízaro* [detribalized enslaved Native American people] identity places itself out of the tri-cultural myth and embraces Indigneous identity and the realization of violence and trauma, and the ways in which we remember a violent colonial history" — Moises Gonzales, *¡Colores!*
