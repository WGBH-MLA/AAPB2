# Part 1: Reclaiming Histories

1

## Summary

The act of reclaiming histories involves recovering perspectives and stories of peoples within a society at collective and individual levels that testify to their often unacknowledged active participation in past events. Through this process, communities can challenge histories that have denied visibility to groups that otherwise have been rendered “marginal” by mainstream society. 

This section features programs about communities, institutions, and movements that have demanded and created change in New Mexico by challenging the status quo. Representing a broad range of topics, the programs in this section cover Indigenous and other local civilian demonstrations against public monuments valorizing colonial conquest, Black Lives Matter activists demanding an end to systemic racism and police brutality, prison inmate demands for reform, and more. These programs underscore the longstanding importance of activism, dissent, and resistance that significantly shape New Mexico’s intricate histories. 

> "We want our kids to succeed. We have dreams for our children, too. We don't dream of our children one of these days ending up in the penitentiary." — Nadine Cordova, *New Mexico in Focus*
