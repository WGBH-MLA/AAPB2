>**Much of the world’s best farmland is now threatened because our species lacks commitment to a spiritual and ethical vision of our interconnectedness with the land. Farmland is primary human habitat, and black winds, dark rivers are carrying it away. Our good health, the smiles on the faces of our grandchildren are being carried to places beyond our reach.** 

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—*Soil and Survival: Land Stewardship and the Future of American Agriculture* (1986) [<sup>17</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#17) 

The intimate connections between agriculture and the environment make sense at a glance, not only because the industry is firmly embedded in the natural world but also because of its scale. According to a [2012 report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/84880/eib-178_summary.pdf?v=6294.7) on land use from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, of the nearly 2.3 billion acres of national territory, 29 percent is used for grassland pasture and 17 percent for cropland, totaling 46 percent for these traditional industries alone. The impacts of agricultural choices about [Land](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land) management—the use of pesticides, controlled burning for farm land, crop rotation, and topsoil depletion—have been a topic of conversation for both rural and urban dwellers as new technical and [Industrial](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/6-practice#Industry) changes have developed over the last century. Public programming has responded to this conversation, unpacking the enduring (and sometimes fraught) connections between farming and nature.

But how does environmental impact vary by region? By state? What issues are centered in conversations about climate and the future? What ecological concepts gain symbolic and cultural resonance? The programs and [Places](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Place) featured in this anchor—from the cattle ranches of Wyoming to the hydroponic farms of Florida—tackle these questions and more by focusing on ideas of [Crisis](#Crisis), [Soil](#Soil), and [Weather](#Weather).

[**Crisis**](#Crisis) is a concept often writ large in broadcast coverage of agricultural news. Disasters, extreme weather, dwindling [Resources](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Resources)—it’s not difficult to see how these forces shape how we talk about farming. Some crises are framed as acts of God, from volcanic eruptions to sudden and devastating droughts. But some are acknowledged as man-made. The AAPB collection includes reports on the effects of air pollution and contamination on agricultural industry and practice. As scientists have reported for decades, climate change may lead to further crises on the farm: severe droughts and floods impacting production, carbon dioxide levels disturbing plant growth, and the growth of pests affecting both plants and livestock.  [<sup>18</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#18)

Perhaps one of the most significant agricultural crises of the twentieth century—the Dust Bowl of the 1930s—has been discussed as both a weather and man-made disaster. But at its heart, it is an issue of [**Soil**](#Soil): a component of agriculture that is rich with symbolic and practical significance. In this section, the programs demonstrate how farmers and agriculturalists talk about soil conditions and conservation, often with a sustainable future in mind.

Those who work in farming, regardless of their location, know of the importance of paying attention to the [**Weather**](#Weather). Whether it’s a years-long drought or a seemingly light rain shower, the effects of changing weather conditions and patterns can have significant effects on day-to-day work. The programs featured in this section explore not only atmospheric conditions but also the seasonal rhythms of farm work.

[***Hold Your Breath***, **“Agricultural Problems Caused by Air Pollution”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_500-3t9d8r5g) **(Michigan State University WKAR, East Lansing, October 9, 1963).**

“Just hold your breath,” the narrator begins in this radio series. “Hold your breath as long as you can, and you’ll soon discover how vital this natural [Resource](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Resources) is.” This particular episode considers the agricultural and economic costs of air pollution. The 1963 program is a part of *Hold Your Breath*, a series from Michigan State University that was devoted to discussions of the dangers of air pollution, which anticipated the major [amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1970](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/evolution-clean-air-act). As national concern about air quality heightened, local stations explored the multifaceted nature of this crisis. Here, for example, we learn more about how irradiated hydrocarbons (produced from vehicle exhaust) impact the [Land](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land), [Harvest](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/3-work#Harvest), and [Soil](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/4-environment#Soil) conditions from a county supervisor from Orange County, California.

[***The MacNeil/Lehrer Report***, **“Forgotten Farms”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_507-rv0cv4cs8m) **(WNET/WETA, New York/Washington, April 10, 1980).**

Not all environmental crises are natural. This episode of *The MacNeil/Lehrer Report* covers the 1973 contamination of cattle feed in Michigan, which resulted in human ingestion of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) through the consumption of meat and dairy products, causing a statewide health crisis. The crisis and coverage demonstrate how rural, agricultural issues can have devastating impacts on [Places](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Place) beyond the farm through interconnected food networks.

[***A Year of Ash: Mount St. Helen's Impact on Agriculture***](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_296-09j3tzq8) **(prod. Alison Hansel, Northwest Public Television, 1981).**

This documentary explores how farmers, feed lot managers, and scientists responded in the wake of Mount St. Helen’s eruption in 1980. With the significant ash fall and changes to the mineral composition of the soil, concern rose from scientists and farmers about high-acidity dust, starving livestock, contaminated crops, and rusting equipment. Though some effects were mild, the discussion around the aftermath demonstrates how those working in the agricultural sector mitigate risk and attempt to anticipate future crises. As the narrator concludes, “There is no ending to this story. As long as the Cascade Mountains from Washington to northern California are dormant but not dead, the chance for another eruption is there.”

[***New Mexico in Focus***, **episode 323, “Gray Wolf Reintroduction”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-191-257d805d) **(KNME-TV, Albuquerque, NM, March 17, 2000).**

Agricultural work is not only about responding to the aftereffects of disasters or crises; oftentimes it’s about anticipating them. This program considers the controversy surrounding the reintroduction of the Mexican gray wolf population into New Mexico. Environmentalists were eager to reintroduce this indigenous at-risk species and restore the natural ecosystem of the area, but local ranchers pushed back vehemently out of concerns about potential violence against livestock and families. Here, differing environmental priorities were debated between conservationists and cattle growers as they heatedly discussed wolf recovery and agriculture.

### Philosophy

[***Local Issue***, **“Death of a Small Farm”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-183416tt1k) **(KUON-TV, Lincoln, Nebraska, National Educational Television, September 10, 1967).**

As far back as the mid-twentieth century, media broadcasts have speculated about the fate of the family farm. More than a model of agriculture, the family farm is a lifestyle often tied to philosophical ideas of [Stewardship](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Stewardship), self-sufficiency, and a locally-focused perspective. The 1967 broadcast out of Lincoln, Nebraska, adds to that [Rhetoric](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/7-politics#Rhetoric), calling the family farm an “institution,” the “King of American Agriculture,” and connecting it to the social and economic health of rural communities. Reporter R. Neale Copple focuses on the shift towards larger, consolidated, and specialized farming while lamenting the [Movement](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/3-work#Movement) of workers from farms to cities. Later broadcasts in this collection explore how family farms became subsumed by larger agribusiness and corporate farming, but the “uprooting” and “exodus” of the [Youth](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/5-culture#Youth) (to use the [Rhetoric](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/7-politics#Rhetoric) of this broadcast) seems to be one of the prime anxieties at this stage in the industry’s history. Copple ends on a note of optimism: just as the “shiny, powerful tractor” replaced the horse, so, too, will the old style of farming be replaced by a more productive, prosperous model, confirming an [Industrial](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/6-practice#Industry) mindset even as he mourns the decline of the family farm.

[**“San Juan Pueblo – Rio Grande Farmers Version”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-207-58bg7gmc) **(KUNM, Albuquerque, New Mexico, ca. 1994).**

This radio broadcast considers the [Methods](#Method) and philosophy of farmers living in the San Juan Pueblo of New Mexico as they navigate the balance between traditional agricultural practice and new [Methods](#Method] and technology. The San Juan Agricultural Cooperative, which was formed in part to support tribal income, has incorporated new technology such as a solar dryer and dehydrator in their green chili production, while others in the community have sought to preserve old melon seeds: heirlooms which had been passed down through generations. “We look back at the old ways and say: What was it that we used to do that built a lot of the harmony and the value system what our tribe was based on?“ says Joe Garcia, governor of the Pueblo. “So we looked back and said farming was one of them. And that’s the down-to-earth thing—we’re working our hands; we’re forming communal groups.”

[***Tobacco Blues***](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-359-655dvdvw) **(dir. Christine Fugate, Café Sisters Productions and KET, 1997).**

More than a program on the tobacco [Industry](#Industry), this documentary, which was broadcast on the PBS series *POV*, is an exploration of the lives of Kentucky tobacco farmers as issues of public health, financial stability, morality, family <f>Tradition, and [Politics](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/7-politics) collide. It underscores the differences between corporate tobacco and the farmers who are often the ones to feel the unequal economic impact of regulation. But behind these conversations is the shifting social perception of smoking as well as the broader question: who is ethically implicated in the cultivation of potentially harmful substances? 

[***Florida Matters***, **episode 3, “Going Green in Florida”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_304-97xkt66p) **(WUSF, Tampa, FL, February 13, 2009).**

The first segment of this episode explores urban approaches to sustainability through small-scale agriculture. Here, sustainability is tied to a local philosophy: relying on food and other [Resources](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Resources) that are close to home in order to minimize global shipping and transport emissions. Jim Kovaleski lives in the suburbs of New Port Richey, Florida, and has transformed his yard into productive farmland, albeit on a smaller scale. In his interview for the program, Kovaleski couches his project it as “farming” rather than just gardening, expanding ideas about of [Land](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land) use and sustainability while exploring new applications of permaculture, natural pesticides, and local foraging and [Harvest](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/3-work#Harvest) in unexpected [Places](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Place).
