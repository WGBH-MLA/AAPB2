>**The point is that use does not indicate in any real way his idea of the land. Use is neither his work nor his idea. As an Indian I think: you say that I use the land, and I reply, yes, it is true; but it is not the first truth. The first truth is that I love the land; I see that it is beautiful; I delight in it; I am alive in it.**

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - N. Scott Momaday, Kiowa novelist[<sup>9</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#9)  

What is our relationship with the land we inhabit? How do we use it? Cultivate it? Conserve it? How do issues of displacement, dispossession, and dispute impact the way we see our place in the land? This connection is at once a question of philosophy, economy, spirituality, and ideology, and different groups have put forward competing land ethics while trying to answer these questions. This Anchor explores how those involved in agriculture express their ties to the land through ideas of [Stewardship](#Stewardship), [Place](#Place), and [Resources](#Resources).

In the history of the United States as a nation, the debate about land ownership has often been framed around the issue of land use. The landmark [Homestead Act of 1862](https://guides.loc.gov/homestead-act) encouraged westward settlement, promising settlers land if they agreed to live on and “improve” the land through farming. This ideal of cultivation is often talked about as a social good, but what are the consequences of this mindset? What alternative visions of stewardship might we imagine? The [**Stewardship**](#Stewardship) section highlights different perspectives on how to take care of and relate to the land from a number of voices and regions.

The diverse regional landscape of the U.S. is especially striking from an agricultural perspective: from swampy alligator farming in the South to the carefully lined rows of fruit trees in the Northeast. The [**Place**](#Place) section explores not only the regional differences in farming but, more crucially, how farm people from diverse communities express connections to place and land. Placemaking is at its heart an act of imagination, connecting one’s environment to abstract ideas like home and homeland. “Geography,” writes scholars Kent C. Ryden, “is clearly much more than buildings and dirt—it supports a complex structure of personal and cultural significance.”[<sup>10</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#10)  Here, too, you’ll find conversations about how the urban/rural divide becomes less clear as communities find new ways to ensure access to food and other resources.

The issues of stewardship and placemaking go hand-in-hand with the need for [**Resources**](#Resources). The acquisition and maintenance of land under industrial agriculture has relied on access to capital—often through government programs such as the [Agricultural Adjustment Act (1938)]( https://www.loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=1821e70c01de48ae899a7ff708d6ad8b) or through private loans by banks and other lending agencies. But as we can see from twentieth and twenty-first century public programming, land loss is, at its center, a question of resource access. What do we consider to be a resource? What barriers do individuals and groups face when applying for agricultural aid? How do we provide for future generations of farmers?

[***Standing Silent Nation***](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-508-4t6f18t131) **(dir. Suree Towfighnia, Prairie Dust Films, July 3, 2007).**

This documentary, broadcast on the PBS series POV, follows the efforts of the White Plume family (Oglala Lakota) to cultivate industrial hemp for livestock feed, papercrafts, and commercial sale on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Having been legalized under tribal law, hemp was not only a valuable [Resource](#Resources) in the community’s economic development but also offered a meaningful connection with the land through [Labor](#Labor). But backlash from the federal government led to raids, property seizure, and a legal battle for the White Plumes and others who sought to uphold Native sovereignty in the face of unjust [Policies](#Policy). “In our treaties with America,” says Debra White Plume, “we retained our sovereignty. It’s not something America gave us. Sovereignty is not something that can be given to anyone.” 

[***North Carolina Now***](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_129-31qfv1qn) **(UNC-TV, Research Triangle Park, NC, September 30, 1990).**

This local news broadcast includes a segment with interviews from Black farmers, historians, and extension agents in Tillery, North Carolina. They discuss how New Deal-era land allocation programs impacted Black farmers and the material and ideological importance of land ownership and access to [Resources](#Resources). “It was an opportunity for African Americans to own property, to actually not be dependent on the large white plantation owners for their livelihood,” says Gary Grant from the Concerned Citizens of Tillery organization. “It afforded them an opportunity to be independent. It afforded them an opportunity to set direction for their own lives.” 

[***The MacNeil/Lehrer Report***, **“Indian Sovereignty and The Longest March”**]( https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-507-6d5p844f8j.) **(WNET/WETA, New York/Washington, July 13, 1978).**

This episode of the *MacNeil/Lehrer Report* explores the settlement of reservation land by non-Native civilians and disputes over water access rights in northwestern states like Washington and Idaho. Those speaking on behalf of the tribes push back against the encroachment and infringement of treaty-guaranteed property, while non-tribal members express feelings of mistrust and suspicion. In the essay “Adaptation, Resistance, and Representation in the Modern US Settler State,” historian Walter L. Hixson discusses colonial anxieties that are often expressed during sovereignty struggles: “In an effort to reassert a sense of authority, the colonizer effects an inversion in which tribes are framed as colonizers […] demanding special privileges. Under this frame, the ethnic minority becomes the aggressor and the majority population the victims.” [<sup>11</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#11)
  
[***The MacNeil/Lehrer Report***, “Saving Farmlands”](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_507-sq8qb9w11d) **(WNET/WETA, New York/Washington, October 17, 1977).**

This 1977 national report considers the issue of shrinking farm as development rights to the land are bought and sold. Agricultural reporter Carol Buckland talks with farmers and residents on Long Island in New York, where the Suffolk County government stepped in to aid farmers by buying the rights to their land to ensure its agricultural use in the face of growing suburbanization. Those interviewed, such as John Talmage of Baiting Hollow, New York, justify its use as farmland and explain why government intervention is necessary, connecting with issues of food [Resources](#Resources) and [Place](#Place): “But also one might ask the question, is there some safety in having our production spread around a little bit? For instance, if something happened to our transportation system, […] there are a lot of people living on Long Island and having the reserve of the food production—at least some food production on Long Island—should add a little safety to living here.”
