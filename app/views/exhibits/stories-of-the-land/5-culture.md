>**Among the first things one learns from the practice of agriculture, whether one comes to it by birthright—raised in the country—or transplanted from the city, is that farming is not a mere mechanical, scientific, or even economic enterprise, but a social and thus cultural one.**

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Thomas F. Pawlick, journalist [<sup>19</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#19)

Here, we take in the cultural dimensions of agriculture: the art, the stories, and the social events that shape and are shaped by the occupational practices of farming. More than a science, more than an [Industry](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/6-practice#Industry), agriculture is deeply embedded in social life and historical memory. But there is no singular expression of agrarian culture in the United States. By exploring some of the [Stories](#Story), [Folklife](#Folklife), and [Youth](#Youth) activities showcased in public broadcasting throughout the decades, this Anchor invites you to consider how diverse stories can connect through shared issues of education, finance, opportunity, and remembrance.

[**Stories**](#Story) play an intimate role in constructing and remembering the past. Stories about agriculture, specifically, can reflect shifting environmental concerns, philosophies of land stewardship, and perceptions of history. But in telling stories of the country’s agricultural past, we must contend with issues of slavery, land loss, and the immigrant experience. What do we prioritize in our storytelling? What do we gloss over? In this section, the featured programs examine how storytelling on the farm reflects certain mindsets about the past.

“[**Folklife**](#Folklife) is community life and values, artfully expressed in myriad forms and interactions,” writes folklorist Mary Hufford. “Universal, diverse, and enduring, it enriches the nation and makes us a commonwealth of cultures.”[<sup>20</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#20) In the United States, agricultural folklife is often expressed vividly through festival: state and county fairs, food-themed cooking events, seasonal harvest shows. The programs in this section come from a variety of regions across the country, but many of them highlight the financial stakes of these events, demonstrating not only their cultural significance but also their ties to tourism and local economies. 

Many folklife and festival events are geared towards the younger generation, sharing knowledge through engaging cultural experiences. The [**Youth**](#Youth) section of this exhibit explores both programming for and about youth involvement in agriculture. Organizations such as 4-H clubs and Future Farmers of America (FFA) articulate their vested interest in providing for farming futures, but the realities of farm work aren’t always centered in broader conversations about youth education and development. What does opportunity mean for those families working on farms? What resources are available, and what activities are prioritized?
