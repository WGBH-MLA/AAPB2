What do we call someone who works the land? This deceptively simple question has myriad answers that illustrate the range of agricultural work: farmer, rancher, grower, farm worker, farm manager, processor, producer, and so on. But what do these categories reveal about the material realities of farm labor? Scholar Laura-Anne Minkoff-Zern critiques the “agrarian myth” in her book, *The New American Farmer: Immigration, Race, and the Struggle for Sustainability*. The myth can be traced back to early writers in the United States, including Thomas Jefferson, who described the farmer as the ideal model for a citizen of the republic: a mix of independence and dedication to their land that ultimately enhances social connection. This idealized agrarianism, Minkoff-Zern writes, “promotes the notion that in the United States, a country founded by hardworking individual farmers, land access has been democratically distributed” and that “all individuals who work the land diligently with their own hands (with no help from slave or hired labor) have access to upward agrarian mobility.” [<sup>15</sup>](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/notes#15) But the economic and social barriers to farm ownership and [Stewardship](#stewardship) undermine this ideal, often at the cost of those most vulnerable to discrimination and disenfranchisement. 

Public broadcasting explores some of the nuances of farm work through stories from all of the categories listed above, from fishing processors in Alaska to prison-farm workers in New Jersey. This Anchor reflects on the economic and lived realities of agricultural work from a variety of perspectives. Here, the concept of “Work” invokes ideas of [Harvest](#harvest), [Labor](#labor), and [Movement](#movement), and the featured programs demonstrate how elements of race, gender, class, and culture relate to these concepts even as they complicate conventional assumptions about what it means to work the land.

[**Harvest**](#harvest) represents both objects and actions: what is gathered together as well as the process of collection. Products can be harvested—corn, tobacco, freshwater mussels—but the phrase *to harvest* also denotes the labor that goes into the process. This section examines the diversity of farmed products across the nation, broadening our perspectives on what might be considered agriculture.

The [**Labor**](#labor) of the harvest is both physical and emotional. But not all labor has been visible to the public; often the representative American farmer has been pictured as a stoic, white, male figure toiling in his fields. But the public radio and television programs in this section offer different stories, from the collective actions of the United Farm Workers to the reflections of farm women enduring a harsh Wisconsin winter. These programs make visible the diverse experiences of working the land, highlighting underrepresented voices and sharing dimensions of labor that often go unacknowledged.

At first, we may think of agricultural work as fixed in place—in fields or barns or brooder houses, firmly rooted in the land—but farm labor is often about [**Movement**](#movement): the movement of products, the movement of people. This section highlights the experiences of migration in farming, navigating borders between states and nations, and the challenges faced by those on the road to new fields.

### Harvest

In May 1979, [the WGBH program *Say Brother* covered the Black Studies programs at colleges within the Boston area](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-9s17ss5w): Harvard University, Boston University, and Northeastern University. Journalist George Rivera went inside the programs to “establish a case delineating some of the perpetual, institutional obstacles placed on Afro Studies programs from their inception” and with the hope to “present information that would spur continued support for the expansion and enrichment of university-subsidized, Third World heritage programs.” When speaking with Black faculty at Northeastern University, Rivera noted that the school itself had an “African American Institute” that had preceded the school’s Black Studies program, where community members and students could take coursework on Black culture free of charge. Despite this access and support, Black students at Northeastern who attended these classes could not receive actual college credit for them. Dean Gregory Hicks revealed to Rivera that a group of twenty-five minority students—backed by the Ford Foundation to diversify the student body—had demanded racial equity from the university administration in 1968 and saw their plans for the institute realized after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In 1973, the Department of African American Studies was founded, only five years after Northeastern’s African American Institute was established. Dr. Virgil Wood, the institute’s director, described his responsibility to “plan and implement a range of academic and support programs, both cultural and social for Black students at Northeastern.” Wood stated that many Black students at universities were subjected to a “revolving door” where they were recruited, but not retained through graduation, and he believed that his institute could bridge the retention gap Black students faced. Dr. Holly Carter, who served as the chairwoman of Northeastern’s African American Studies program during its early years, spoke for the importance of the institute and the department working as a unit in order to service the marginalized Black students.

[**“Just a Small Fishery” (KYUK, Bethel, AK, September 20, 1984)**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-127-98mcvsx7).
This television program explores commercial and subsistence aquaculture in western Alaska. The fishery featured here represents the commercial interest in herring along the coastline. In the broadcast, fishing cooperative members discuss prices and the impacts of overfishing this aquatic [Resource](#resources), locals follow the herring migration runs in their small fishing boats, and larger, [Industrial](#industry) processing vessels collect their hauls for sale on the market. The program expands definitions of agriculture, emphasizing that harvest can occur far from the dirt and soil of conventional farm land.

[***Louisiana Conservationist Magazine***, **episode 208, “Larto Saline Complex and Alligator Farming”**] (https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_17-90rr5zt9) **(Louisiana Public Broadcasting, Baton Rouge, January 3, 1991).** 
One of the segments in this newsmagazine examines alligator farming: an industrial approach to raising gators for leather and meat production that began to gain traction in the 1970s. The journalists tour one of the facilities in 1990 where the animals were incubated and raised with carefully managed temperature chambers to control growth and development. By employing the [Rhetoric](#rhetoric) of [Industry](#industry)—“conversion” to describe butchering, “food intake” to describe feeding, and “renewable [Resource](#resources)” to describe propagation—proponents of this approach frame alligator farming as an industry worth cultivating.

[***WPLN News Archive***, **“Tennessee Mussels”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-50c34997d95) **(WPLN/Nashville Public Radio, July 1, 2003).** 
This radio segment explores how pearls are farmed and produced through a careful process of implantation and culturing: materials (called “nuclei”) are deposited into the mollusks that are then left to develop into this luxury [Resource](#resources) over a series of years. Though cultured pearls are a global [Industry](#industry), the ideal nuclei can be found in freshwater mussels from places like the Tennessee Freshwater Pearl Farm in Benton County: the spiny mussel, rough rabbitsfoot, purple wartyback, Cumberland monkeyface, birdwing pearlymussel. Tennessee pearl farmers are interviewed in this broadcast, discussing the harvesting process and the state’s significance within the global industry. As the narrator concludes, “Tennessee mussels are the heart of the world pearl market, making Tennessee the true mother of pearl.”

[***Notes on Milk***](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-c132bb3bd83) **(dir. Ariana Gerstein and Monteith McCollom, 2010).** 
This short documentary, broadcast on the PBS series *POV*, considers the <f>Cultural and <f>Political entanglements of a major agricultural <f>Industry in the United States: dairy. From the breakfast table to the Watergate investigations, milk as a product and a symbol is powerfully connected to how the country is imagined and envisioned. With interviews from former and current dairy farmers, this artful program explores how consumers, producers, and product are entangled.
