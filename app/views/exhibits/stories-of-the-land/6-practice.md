[***Local Issue***, **“Death of a Small Farm”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-516-183416tt1k) **(KUON-TV, Lincoln, Nebraska, National Educational Television, September 10, 1967).**

As far back as the mid-twentieth century, media broadcasts have speculated about the fate of the family farm. More than a model of agriculture, the family farm is a lifestyle often tied to philosophical ideas of [Stewardship](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Stewardship), self-sufficiency, and a locally-focused perspective. The 1967 broadcast out of Lincoln, Nebraska, adds to that [Rhetoric](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/7-politics#Rhetoric), calling the family farm an “institution,” the “King of American Agriculture,” and connecting it to the social and economic health of rural communities. Reporter R. Neale Copple focuses on the shift towards larger, consolidated, and specialized farming while lamenting the [Movement](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/3-work#Movement) of workers from farms to cities. Later broadcasts in this collection explore how family farms became subsumed by larger agribusiness and corporate farming, but the “uprooting” and “exodus” of the [Youth](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/5-culture#Youth) (to use the [Rhetoric](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/7-politics#Rhetoric) of this broadcast) seems to be one of the prime anxieties at this stage in the industry’s history. Copple ends on a note of optimism: just as the “shiny, powerful tractor” replaced the horse, so, too, will the old style of farming be replaced by a more productive, prosperous model, confirming an [Industrial](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/6-practice#Industry) mindset even as he mourns the decline of the family farm.

[**“San Juan Pueblo – Rio Grande Farmers Version”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-207-58bg7gmc) **(KUNM, Albuquerque, New Mexico, ca. 1994).**

This radio broadcast considers the [Methods](#Method) and philosophy of farmers living in the San Juan Pueblo of New Mexico as they navigate the balance between traditional agricultural practice and new [Methods](#Method] and technology. The San Juan Agricultural Cooperative, which was formed in part to support tribal income, has incorporated new technology such as a solar dryer and dehydrator in their green chili production, while others in the community have sought to preserve old melon seeds: heirlooms which had been passed down through generations. “We look back at the old ways and say: What was it that we used to do that built a lot of the harmony and the value system what our tribe was based on?“ says Joe Garcia, governor of the Pueblo. “So we looked back and said farming was one of them. And that’s the down-to-earth thing—we’re working our hands; we’re forming communal groups.”

[***Tobacco Blues***](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-359-655dvdvw) **(dir. Christine Fugate, Café Sisters Productions and KET, 1997).**

More than a program on the tobacco [Industry](#Industry), this documentary, which was broadcast on the PBS series *POV*, is an exploration of the lives of Kentucky tobacco farmers as issues of public health, financial stability, morality, family <f>Tradition, and [Politics](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/7-politics) collide. It underscores the differences between corporate tobacco and the farmers who are often the ones to feel the unequal economic impact of regulation. But behind these conversations is the shifting social perception of smoking as well as the broader question: who is ethically implicated in the cultivation of potentially harmful substances? 

[***Florida Matters***, **episode 3, “Going Green in Florida”**](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_304-97xkt66p) **(WUSF, Tampa, FL, February 13, 2009).**

The first segment of this episode explores urban approaches to sustainability through small-scale agriculture. Here, sustainability is tied to a local philosophy: relying on food and other [Resources](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Resources) that are close to home in order to minimize global shipping and transport emissions. Jim Kovaleski lives in the suburbs of New Port Richey, Florida, and has transformed his yard into productive farmland, albeit on a smaller scale. In his interview for the program, Kovaleski couches his project it as “farming” rather than just gardening, expanding ideas about of [Land](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land) use and sustainability while exploring new applications of permaculture, natural pesticides, and local foraging and [Harvest](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/3-work#Harvest) in unexpected [Places](/exhibits/stories-of-the-land/2-land#Place).
