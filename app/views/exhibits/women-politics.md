# Women, Politics, and Public Broadcasting

## Summary

From the colonial days, where women had very few rights, to today, where their political and legal rights that are almost equal to men’s, the political landscape for women in the U.S. has shifted dramatically. This was achieved with self-advocacy from women, especially through the three waves of feminism.

Debating the issues in the public sphere has always been a part of any fight for civil rights, and women’s rights are no exception. Public broadcasting made it possible to have debates for viewers and listeners to understand for themselves what the issues and arguments were from all sides of the debates.

## Main

### Women’s Rights & Public Broadcasting:

In August 1920, after nearly 80 years of agitation, Americans passed the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, legally giving women the right to vote. First wave feminists and suffragists who pushed for this landmark legislation argued that women should have political rights because of their uniquely maternal commitment to the public good. Yet the right to vote enshrined in the 19th Amendment was, in practice, restricted to white women. Poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation kept women of color from voting, and laws declaring that women’s citizenship was tied to their husbands’ citizenship prevented many American women from casting ballots.

Voting rights were one way women fought to change a balance of power that favored white men. Civil rights were another. The 1950s saw the expansion the African-American civil rights movement, a movement chronicled by the public television stations founded across the nation in that same decade. . This movement helped to kick off a series of social revolutions. It emboldened other groups, including women and Native Americans, to fight for physical safety, voting rights, equal educational and employment opportunity, and equal treatment under the law.

Second wave feminists of the 1970s supported the passage of an  Equal Rights Amendment that forbade discrimination on the basis of sex, advocated for reproductive rights, and urged more representation of women on all levels of government. These ideas shaped the politics of the 1970s and continue to stir debate today. Today’s third wave feminists have continued to champion these ideas, while acknowledging how different racial, gender, sexual, religious, and socioeconomic identities influence a woman’s roles and treatment. This new attention to  ‘intersectionality’ and the different forms oppression can take continues to fuel debate about what rights women, and all minorities hold.  Throughout these shifts, public television and radio have provided outlets for ideas and debates about women’s changing social, economic and political roles.

Though women have held Congressional office in the United States since 1917, this generally occurred when widows were appointed to their late husband’s seat to finish out their term. As second wave feminism took hold, however, more women ran for office and won. Because of public broadcasting’s long chronological reach over the 20th and 21st centuries and the broad geographical breadth that local stations cover, many women’s campaigns and term(s) in office are documented in the archive. The AAPB contains programming and interviews featuring women in local office including mayors, governors, and state representatives as well as women in national politics, who have served in Congress, in presidential Cabinets, and women who have run for President of the United States. While many such programs are featured here, this exhibit focuses specifically on women discussing women’s issues. Many more recordings featuring women in elected office can be found and explored in the archive.

Public broadcasting enabled ordinary women, activists, political organizations and politicians to debate controversial issues related to gender, sex and politics. The varied viewpoints they presented helped to educate and inform the public about important issues facing women and society. Bringing the debate directly into people's homes made public broadcasting an important vehicle for informing and educating the public. Though the women’s movement was not always unified in their goals, they were able to make important strides towards women’s legal and social equality. Further, public broadcasting offered a platform to women frequently marginalized by society, and provided ample time to debate issues that profit-driven media often ignored. his exhibit will present many different perspectives presented during this time using the extensive resources in the AAPB, as well as highlight the impact that women have had on American life and politics.
