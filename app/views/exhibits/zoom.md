### Introduction

On January 9, 1972, the children’s television series *ZOOM* premiered on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) affiliates across the country. Designed for an audience between the ages of seven and twelve, *ZOOM* focused on young people making and sharing their own fun. Its distinctive claim was that viewers sent in the ideas for the jokes, plays, games and other activities that a cast of children known as ZOOMers then shared with its national viewership. The series addressed this audience as active cultural producers who had interesting talents and ideas to convey; each week, the cast [recited](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-27mpgfq1?start=735.93&end=829.58) WGBH’s postal address as a poem, ending in song, such that the repeated call to [“Send it to *ZOOM*”](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-3331znzg?start=1668.26&end=1718) likely made “02134” the best-known zip code among American children of the 1970s. As the series’ theme song asked, “Who are you? / What do you do? / How are you? / Let’s hear from you! / We need [you](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-16c2g0jn?start=25.58&end=118.33)!” 

Produced at public television station WGBH in Boston, *ZOOM* was one of the most successful non-commercial children’s series of the 1970s. Over the course of six seasons, millions of American children watched *ZOOM*, and they responded to its exhortation to participate by sending in an average of 10,000 letters every week.[<sup>1</sup>](/exhibits/zoom/notes#1) Some viewers suggested themes for discussion among the ZOOMers, or passed along [tongue twisters and riddles](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-22v41zdg?start=147.88&end=324.12).[<sup>2</sup>](/exhibits/zoom/notes#2)  Others shared original [plays](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-83xsjkh9?start=934.61&end=1087.76), [poems](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-71ngfff7?start=1219.62&end=1350.21), [stories](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-17crjpmm?start=421.42&end=537.26), and [artwork](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-988gv19k?start=1596.19&end=1728.93). Many wrote in asking for specific *ZOOM* cards, which contained information about activities highlighted on previous episodes; these viewers generally included a [SASE](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-81wdc6rs?start=1299.05&end=1318.67), or self-addressed stamped envelope, in anticipation of a reply. By 1976, *ZOOM* had received over two million letters.[<sup>3</sup>](/exhibits/zoom/notes#3)

In the 1960s and 1970s, advocates for educational television for children argued that the medium could be more thoughtful, creative, and informative. Better-quality television shows, these innovators contended, could teach young viewers useful skills, inculcate positive values, and prepare children for the world beyond their living rooms.[<sup>4</sup>](/exhibits/zoom/notes#4) *ZOOM* exemplified this kind of project. By watching *ZOOM*, children acquired new skills ranging from [tie-dying](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-26xwdm9r?start=211.56&end=376.84) fabric to [candle-making](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-54kkwwf2?start=259.28&end=462.75). They discovered [games](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-31cjt77t?start=1362.21&end=1498.28) and [tests of skill](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-0644j8kn?start=250.82&end=334.1) that other young fans had contributed. And they learned about a diverse range of [children](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-58bg7q15?start=309.23&end=610.04) [across](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-289gj7pp?start=315.73&end=635.05) the [country](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-88cfz5p7?start=256.2&end=553.55) who [appeared](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-171vhs7m?start=424.04&end=744.69) in [short](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-49t1gcnh?start=246.62&end=535.92) [documentaries](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-977src1z?start=961.22&end=1333.89) as [ZOOMguests](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-375tbddb?start=1079.93&end=1338.24). Outside of the commercial realm of children’s media, *ZOOM* also taught its young viewers new ways of connecting with other children as participants in the creative process. What children saw on their television screens affirmed their own sense of their capabilities, interests, and membership in this larger community.

Adults were generally enchanted by *ZOOM*. Press coverage of the series was very positive, and *ZOOM* won Emmys for children’s programming in 1973, 1974, and 1977.[<sup>5</sup>](/exhibits/zoom/notes#5) Many parents also commended the series. One California mother praised its liberating models of boyhood for her teenage sons: “It’s good for boys to see other boys who are not afraid to dance, and sing, and play clapping games. Those children represent the spontaneous creative, intelligent people we want our children to become.” A Minnesota mother explained that she found the show’s lack of rudeness refreshing: “I am a Christian and I am fussy about TV shows. I’m thankful you don’t use such words as ‘Shut up’ and the other slang words.”[<sup>6</sup>](/exhibits/zoom/notes#6) As many other parents contended, *ZOOM* offered a refuge from the commercialization of children’s media.

For the children who were its central audience, *ZOOM* felt like a community of friends. *ZOOM*’s call for viewer-produced [content](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-65h9wf89?start=1017.05&end=1034.14) encouraged young people to see themselves as competent. Anyone could try the [crafts](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-25k992j7?start=1146.23&end=1253.64) and [games](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-72p5j5fn?start=145.19&end=338.69) that ZOOMers demonstrated; anyone could send *ZOOM* a [joke](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-66vx1043?start=130.26&end=324.11) or a [riddle](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-977src1z?start=1334.85&end=1491.37). Although the weekly [song and dance](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-15-3331znzg?start=1503.61&end=1678.61) performances were choreographed, they were obviously performed by amateurs. The inclusion of ZOOMers and ZOOMguests of varied races, religions, regions, and interests further encouraged many young viewers to feel represented by children like themselves. 

Over the course of six seasons, the series effectively served as a national cultural clearinghouse for information and activities of interest to American children. Many children who watched *ZOOM* in the 1970s later described the series as an important cultural benchmark of their youth. The series inspired a second-generation PBS remake, also produced at WGBH (1999-2005), whose audience included some of the sons and daughters of its original fans. Now, instead of sending letters through the U.S. postal service, children could connect with the show via electronic “zmail.” More recently, in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, former ZOOMers from both series contributed ideas for creative stay-at-home activities in the spirit of the original television program.
