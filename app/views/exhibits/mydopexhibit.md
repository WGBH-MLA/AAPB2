## Summary

Like a cruel angel Young man, become a legend  Even if the blue wind knocks on the door of your chest now You’re still looking only at me and smiling Absorbed in yearning for things that you gently touch Your childish eyes still don’t even know destiny  But will you notice someday? That on your back There are wings for aiming for the faraway future  A cruel angel’s these will take off from the windowsill before long On a surging, hot pathos, if you betray your memories Embracing this universe and shining Young man, become a legend  You’re forever sleeping in my cradle of love Only you are the coming morning called upon by the messenger of dreams The moonlight is reflecting your slender nape You want to stop all the time in the world and shut them in, but-  If there’s a meaning in the fact that we were able meet Then that’s right, it’s the bible for me to know freedom  In a cruel angel’s these, the sadness will then start The shape of the life that you embraced is the moment when you woke from your dream Shining more light than anyone else Young man, become a legend  While people weave love, they create history I still can’t become a goddess, yet I’ll live  A cruel angel’s these will take off from the windowsill before long On a surging, hot pathos, if you betray your memories Embracing this universe and shining Young man, become a legend

That's German for " Merry Christmas. " In Germany, Santa's servant Ruprecht gives presents to good children and whipping rods to the parents of bad ones. Merry Kurisumasu. I am Hotseiosha, a japanese priest who acts like Santa Claus. I have eyes in the back ofmy head so children better behave when I'm nearby. Now presenting Lisa Simpson as Tawanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas. Ooh, it's Lisa! That's ours. Ah, the fourth grade will now favor us with a melody-- Uh, medley of holiday "flavorites. " Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Ha ha ha Bells on bobtail ring - Isn't Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like an angel. Oh, jingle bells Batman smells Robin laid an egg The Batmobile broke its wheel The joker got awa-- Jingle bells Jingle bells Jingle all The fifth grade will now favour us with a scene from Charles, uh, Dickens' A Christmas Carol. How many grades does this school have? " Dear friends of the Simpson family, "We had some sadness and some gladness this year. " First, the sadness. Our little cat Snowball "was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. "But we bought a new little cat, Snowball I. "So I guess life goes on. "Speaking of life going on, Grandpa's still with us, feisty as ever. " Maggie is walking by herself, "Lisa got straight A's, and Bart-- "Well, we love Bart. "The magic of the season has touched us all. Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet? - " Homer sends his love. Happy holidays. - Marge! - The Simpsons. " - Marge, where's the extension cord? For heaven's sake, Homer. It's in the utility drawer. Sorry. I'm just a big kid. And I love Christmas so much. D'oh! All right, children, let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole. Oh, please. There's only one fat guy that brings us presents, and his name ain't Santa. Uh-- A pony? Oh, Lisa, you've asked for that for the last three years, and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint? But I really want a pony, - and I've been really good this year. - Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic. - A tattoo? - A what? Yeah! They're cool, and they last the rest of your life. you will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas. Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your allowance. - All right! - Homer! - "Yello. " - Marge, please. - Who's this? May I please speak to Marge? - This is her sister, isn't it? - Is Marge there? - Who shall I say is calling? - Marge, please. It's your sister. Oh! - Hello. - Hello, Marge. It's Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our sister Christmas Eve. Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit too. Somehow I doubt that Homer is excited. of all the men you could've married, I don't know why you picked one who's always so rude to us. - Good one, Dad. Okay, kids, prepare to be dazzled. Marge, turn on the juice! - What do you think, kids? - Nice try, Dad. Just hold your horses, son. Hey, Simpson! - What is it, Flanders? - Do you think this looks okay? Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. - Oh! - Oh, neato! It's too bright. I oughta-- Flanders. What a big show-off. - Kids, wanna go Christmas shopping? - I do! - All right! The mall! - Go get your money. Tell us, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money? Oh, I have my secrets. Turn around. - you can look now. - Ooh! Big jar this year. Oh, Bart, that's so sweet. It's the best present a mother could get, and it makes you look so dangerous. - One " Mother," please. Wait a minute. How old are you? - Twenty-one, sir. - Get in the chair. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Attention, all personnel, please keep working during the following announcement. And now our boss and friend Mr. Burns. Hello. I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase safety here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer or affecting management payraises. However, for you semiskilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses. - Oh, and one more thing. Merry Christmas! - Oh, thank God for the big jar. - Where's that Bart? But, Mom, I thought you'd like it. Yes, Mrs. Simpson, we can remove your son's tattoo. It's a simple routine involving lasers. - Cool! - However, it is rather expensive, and we must insist on a cash payment up front. - Cash? - Mm-hmm. Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus. - Ay, caramba! - Now, whatever you do, don't squirm. you don't wanna get this sucker near your eye or your groin. - Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it. - Ow! Quit it. - Hey, what's with this? Ow! Quit it! Used to be a real boss tattoo. Mom had to spend the Christmas money having it surgically removed. Huh? It's true! The jar is empty! Oh, my God! We're ruined. Christmas is canceled. No presents for anyone! Don't worry, Homer. We'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus - even further this year. - Homer? - Oh, yeah. My Christmas bonus. How silly of me. This'll be the best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had. Hohoho. Hohoho. Hohoho. Ho ho ho. Hohoho. Hmm. I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer. - Huh? Oh. I love you, Marge. - you tell me that all the time. Oh, good, because I do love you. I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping. I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but-- Marge, um, let me be honest with you. - Yes? - Well, I would-- I-- I wanna do the Christmas shopping this year. Uh, sure, okay. Marge, Marge. Hmm. Let'ssee. Ooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack. Oh! Only 4. 99. Ooh! Pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look! A little squeak toy. It says it's for dogs, but she can't read. Ow! Oh, Simpson, it's you. - Hello, Flanders. - Oh, my! What a mess we've got here. Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine? - Well, let's see. - Oh, this one's mine. This one's mine. - This one's mine, and this-- - They're all yours! - Hey, you dropped your pork chop. - Gimme that! - Well, happy holidays, Simpson. - Gee, this is the best Christmas ever. - You bet. What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lump of coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there, sucking on a beer all day long. - So? - So, it's Christmas. - Thanks, Moe. Drinks all around! What's with the crazy getup, Barn? I got me a part-timejob working as a Santa down at the mall. Wow! Can I do that? I don't know. They're pretty selective. Do you like children? What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts? - Hmm. - Uh, I certainly do. Welcome aboard, Simpson. Pending your successful completion of our training program, that is. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. - What is it now, Simpson? - Uh, when do we get paid? Not a dime till Christmas Eve! Now, from the top. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Um, Dasher. - Dancer. - Mm-hmm. - Prancer. - Mm-hmm. Nixon. Comet and Cupid. - Donna Dixon? - Sit down, Simpson. And what would you like, little boy? - You're not really Santa, tubby. - Why, you little egghead! No, Homer! If such an emergency arises, you just tell them Santa's vey busy this time of year, - and you are one of his helpers. - Oh, I knew that one too! Homer, why are you seven hours late? Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub. But, Homer, my sisters are here. - Don't you wanna say hello?
