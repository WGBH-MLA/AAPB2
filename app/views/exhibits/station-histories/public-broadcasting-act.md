## Summary
The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 marked a significant moment in the history of all public broadcasting stations. As President Johnson said at the signing of the Act into law, it gives a  “stronger voice to educational radio and television.” The Act led to the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and National Public Radio (NPR). Some stations chose to document this historic moment in the national public broadcasting landscape through local programming.
