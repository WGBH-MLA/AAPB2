# Native Americans in Contemporary News Media 

5

## Summary

## Extended

Native tribes have a long tradition of producing their own media to inform their communities about significant issues and news. The Cherokee Nation established the first Native newspaper, *The Cherokee Phoenix*, in 1828, which featured Cherokee perspectives on removal legislation and other events that led to the 1830 Indian Removal Act.[<sup>56</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#56)

There have been numerous tribal newspapers, including the [*Navajo Times*](https://navajotimes.com/) and the now out-of-print [*Carolina Indian Voice*](https://www.digitalnc.org/blog/two-more-decades-of-the-carolina-indian-voice-now-available/). The online newspaper [*Indian Country Today*](https://indiancountrytoday.com/) currently is the largest provider of Native news. Established in 1981, the online news platform "covers tribes and Native people throughout the Americas."[<sup>57</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#57)

Beginning in the 1970s, Native communities continued this tradition in the form of Native owned and operated radio stations, such as [KYUK-AM](https://americanarchive.org/participating-orgs/1703) in Bethel, Alaska, and [KWSO-FM](https://americanarchive.org/participating-orgs/4502) in Warm Springs, Oregon. These outlets are discussed in the section, "[Visual Sovereignty: Native-Created Public Media](/exhibits/native-narratives/visual-sovereignty)."

The AAPB holds more than 30 episodes of [*National Native News*](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Bcontributing_organizations%5D%5B%5D=Koahnic+Broadcast+Corporation+%28AK%29&f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=online), a daily news program that highlights Native perspectives on events affecting Native communities. The series, which began airing in 1987, is now distributed to more than 400 radio stations through Native Voice One, a division of Koahnic Broadcast Corporation (KBC).[<sup>58</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#58)

The program represents an important milestone in Native-created media, as it marked the first time that Native Americans across the country could hear programming that reflected important issues and events within their communities. Former host Gary Fife states that the show provides "real stories of Native America" because "the old beads-and-feathers story [presented in white media] just isn’t enough anymore."[<sup>59</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#59) KBC also produces *Native America Calling*, a popular news program out of Alaska that brings listeners together "in a thought-provoking national conversation about issues specific to Native communities."[<sup>60</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#60)

Some non-Native news outlets in areas with substantial Native American populations also have moved towards including a Native perspective in their coverage. [*Neighbors*, a series for KDLG](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Bcontributing_organizations%5D%5B%5D=KDLG+%28AK%29&f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=online&q=neighbors) (Dillingham, Alaska), "features conversations and reports on local public affairs issues, especially those affecting the American Indian community."[<sup>61</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#61) [An episode from 1985 features](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_116-05s7h4n2) interviews with Alaska Natives on the benefits and drawbacks of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act for the Native community. The legislation would later pass in 1991. The ten-part radio series [*The Corporate Whale: ANCSA, Ten Years Later* (KUAC-FM, Fairbanks, Alaska, 1981)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_526-4b2x34np1h) and an episode from the television series [*Outlook* (KAKM, Anchorage, Alaska, 1997)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_235-07gqpdzn) further explores the impact of the legislation and includes clips from Native leaders discussing the Act. Episodes of [*NewsNight Minnesota* (Twin Cities Public Television, Saint Paul, Minnesota)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Bseries_titles%5D%5B%5D=NewsNight+Minnesota&f%5Baccess_types%5D%5B%5D=online) in the AAPB collection that were broadcast between 1994 and 1999 also feature coverage of several issues important to Native American communities, including legal cases surrounding [the Indian Child Welfare Act](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_77-63strh4n) and [fishing rights](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_77-8279dvcn)  for [tribes](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_77-18rbq0sq) residing [in Wisconsin and Minnesota](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_77-816mb36r).

Although it was not an objective, all of the historians and educators in the program, including government officials, are Native Americans, adding depth to the interpretation of history."[<sup>62</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#62)

- ["Indian Boarding Schools"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_511-2z12n5049k) (KPCC-FM, Pasadena, California, 2001)
    
    For nearly two centuries after Europeans arrived in North America, they viewed education as a means to civilize and acculturate native peoples to what they believed to be superior European lifestyles. Because Indian culture was seen as intellectually and morally debased, the federal government removed many Native American children from their homes and sent them to boarding schools. Until the late 19th century, the government located many of these schools hundreds of miles from where the children lived. Indian parents protested the removal of their children, and in later years, the government situated more schools on reservations. Indian boarding schools continued into the 20th century and have been the subject of intense criticism from Native American leaders. In California, the state's only Indian boarding school was established one hundred years ago in the city of Riverside. And as series producer Ilsa Setziol reports, the school still exists today but with a revised mission.

- ["The Dakota Conflict"](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_526-zg6g15vp07) (Twin Cities Public Television, 1993)
    
    "In August of 1862, while the eyes of most Americans were focused on the Civil War, a fierce battle broke out between Minnesota's white European settlers and its native people -- an incident formerly known as the Sioux Uprising. By the end of the year, hundreds of settlers and native Dakota were dead, thousands of Dakota were imprisoned and exiled, and 38 were hanged in a mass public execution the day after Christmas. The story of this violent chapter of Minnesota history, and its causes and aftermath, is told with brutal honesty and with unusual sensitivity to voices previously unheard in this documentary, *The Dakota Conflict*. 'The Dakota Conflict witnessed the clash of two great cultures, who at first found common ground, but then divided in fear, hatred, and misunderstanding,' says producer Kristian Berg, who sought and received the active participation of Dakota advisers from the inception of the project and throughout nine months of researching, writing and production. Co-narrated by Garrison Keillor and Floyd Red Crow Westerman (1936-2007), an Eastern Dakota who played the role of Ten Bears in the movie *Dances with Wolves*, the documentary takes pains to explore the attitudes and points of view of both white settlers and the Dakota people. Through diaries, old photographs, sketchbooks, newspaper archives, trial transcripts and oral histories related from one generation to the next, there unfolds a story of greed, betrayal, lies and vengeance -- along with courage, struggle, faith, and dignity." --1993 Peabody Awards entry form.[<sup>63</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#63)

The program focuses on the history of Poarch Creek Indians, McGee's fight to get Indian children into high schools, the creation of a role for Poarch Creek Indians, and the lawsuit pertinent to the land payment with the Poarch Creek Indians in Oklahoma.

- [*Bemidji Race Relations*](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_526-nv9959dg76) (Minnesota Public Radio, 1995)
    
    "Bemidji Race Relations is a five-part series documenting the historical and present-day racial problems of the native Ojibwe Indians of Northern Minnesota. The city of Bemidji (population 10,000) is a largely white owned, white-run community centered among three major Ojibwe reservations. Small as it is, Bemidji is the commercial hub for much of Northern Minnesota; to reservation Ojibwes, it's a city where Native Americans are met with suspicion and mistreatment. This series examines Ojibwe and White attitudes about local law enforcement practices, education, employment and housing, and recalls the 1966 Reservation boycott of the city -- a microcosm of the Civil Rights movement. While Native Americans in Northern Minnesota have for years expressed outrage and despair over their treatment here, not until Bemidji Race Relations did their voices reach a significant audience on such a wide range of important issues." --1990 Peabody Awards entry form.[<sup>64</sup>](/exhibits/native-narratives/notes#64)
