## Summary

## Main

In September 2011, to protest growing economic inequality in America, the Occupy Wall Street Movement emerged as a group of demonstrators took up camp in Zuccotti Park in New York’s Wall Street financial district. Occupiers soon set up camps throughout the country and the protests continued into 2012. To cover this growing movement, *NewsHour* correspondents interviewed the occupiers in [New York](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-5q4rj49q55?start=1203.34&end=1759.89), [D.C.](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-sb3ws8jr45?start=1479.11&end=2767.69), [Oakland](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-dj58c9s678?start=1128.13&end=1489.14), and [Boise](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-rr1pg1jt35?start=1579.39&end=2115.88), asking them why they were protesting and what were the goals of the movement. In the studio, these conversations continued with academics, politicians, economists, and writers. Correspondent Jeffrey Brown moderated a discussion about the [causes, strengths, and weaknesses](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-3b5w66b25p?start=741.06&end=1338.72) of the movement, and economic correspondent Paul Solman argued the positives and negatives of economic inequality with [Richard Epstein](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-6d5p844s0t?start=2144.96&end=3003.34). Portland occupier Jim Oliver and Mayor Sam Adams were invited on to debate the safety of [Portland’s Occupy Camps](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-kw57d2rd74?start=1204.08&end=1925.42) and whether or not the occupiers in these camps should be evicted. *NewsHour* covered the eviction of occupy camps across the country and showed the often aggressive and violent removal by police of protesters in places such as [U.C. Davis](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-251fj2b76p?start=1906.32&end=2135.93) and [New York City](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-525-2b8v980k0x?start=170.47&end=897.49).
