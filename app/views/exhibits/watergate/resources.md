If you simply can’t get enough of Watergate, there is even more content to watch and read. For the interested visitor, this author recommends the following public television documentaries and video content: Bill Moyers’s [Essay on Watergate](https://vimeo.com/44242486) (1973), [*Summer of Judgment: The Watergate Hearings*](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-mc8rb6ww1z) (1983), [“Covering Watergate: 40 Years Later with MacNeil and Lehrer”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/covering-watergate-40-years-later-with-macneil-and-lehrer) (2013), and [Dick Cavett’s Watergate](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/dick-cavetts-watergate-full-episode/1880/) (2014). If you, like MacNeil and Lehrer, prefer to draw your own conclusions, both the [Nixon Presidential Library](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/index.php) and the [Ford Presidential Library](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/exhibits/Watergate_files/index.html) have extensive online primary source collections including scans of key documents and [recordings of the Oval Office tapes](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/transcripts.php).
