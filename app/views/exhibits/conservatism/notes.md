Buckley Jr., and the American Dream: A Symposium," in *American Political Thought: A Journal of Ideas, Institutions, and Culture* 6.4 (2012).

See his "Buckley, Baldwin, and the Decline of Conservative Racism" in this issue.

<a name="3"></a><sup>3</sup> Direct cinema refers to a style of documentary filmmaking to emerge in the 1950s and 1960s facilitated by the development of small, lightweight film cameras. Direct cinema documentaries present viewers with a fly-on-the-wall perspective on events as they unfold. They typically eschew voice-over narration and direct-to-camera interviews. For a discussion, see Erik Barnouw, *Documentary: A History of the Non-Fiction Film* (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), chapter 5.

<a name="31"></a><sup>31</sup> The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had sought to keep the balance of power between free and slave states; it admitted Maine as a free state, Missouri as a slave state, and established a geographical boundary above which slavery would not be permitted. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, however, allowed residents of Kansas and Nebraska – territories that according to the Missouri Compromise could not allow slavery – to determine for themselves whether to permit slavery within their borders; the Act, in essence, nullified the Missouri Compromise. After the Act’s passage, thirty anti-slavery Whigs met to form a new political organization, the Republican Party.
