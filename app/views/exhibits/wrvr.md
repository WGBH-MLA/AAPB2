# WRVR Riverside Radio: A Pioneering Noncommercial Station

## Summary

This exhibit features recordings from WRVR-FM, the radio station of The Riverside Church in the City of New York, an innovator in noncommercial radio from 1961 to 1971. First and foremost the broadcast voice of a vibrant and distinctive Protestant congregation on Manhattan’s upper West Side, WRVR also helped shape public broadcasting’s early years through its experimental approaches. WRVR was committed to public affairs reporting and formed a news division to cover politics, civic issues, civil rights, and the emerging antiwar movement. WRVR was highly lauded for its arts and cultural programming, featuring classical, jazz, opera, rock, folk, and world music. 

The [WRVR-FM (Riverside Radio) Collection](https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/wrvr-riverside) features over 3,700 recordings representing more than 4,000 hours of WRVR radio from the 1960s and early 1970s. Most of the programs were digitized from reel recordings in the archives of The Riverside Church as part of a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), through the efforts of The Riverside Church archivist Ricki Moskowitz. More than 1,000 recordings of WRVR’s program *Just Jazz with Ed Beac*h were donated to the Library of Congress by its host, Ed Beach. The curator gratefully acknowledges assistance with this exhibit from Rob Bamberger, Thomas Barrick, Casey Davis-Kaufman, Christopher Hartten, Vincent Kelley, Jon Newsom, Cynthia Nixon, Vincent Novara, Loras Schissel, Bill Siemering, Raymond White, and an anonymous reviewer.

### The Riverside Church and WRVR

#### Background

The Riverside Church in the City of New York “often has had a leading hand in crafting the way that liberal American Protestants thought, worshipped, and responded to their times.” The church’s decade-long radio project in the 1960s is one manifestation of Riverside’s longstanding cultural power and influence not just in the immediate New York metropolitan area; even from its founding it became, in many ways, “the national cathedral of mainstream Protestantism.”[<sup>1</sup>](/exhibits/wrvr/notes#1)

John D. Rockefeller, Jr., funded the construction of Riverside’s dramatic limestone cathedral in the Morningside Heights neighborhood near Columbia University. With an endowment gift from the Rockefeller Family Foundation, the congregation of the Park Avenue Baptist Church relocated to the new building in 1930, pastored by liberal minister Harry Emerson Fosdick. Rev. Fosdick was well-known for his theological modernism, evident in his fiery 1922 sermon “Shall the Fundamentalists Win?” which powerfully argued the case for liberal Protestantism during the fundamentalist-modernist controversy of that decade. With Rockefeller’s patronage, Fosdick established The Riverside Church as the premier liberal pulpit of its era and developed the church’s social gospel efforts into the wider city and beyond.  The Riverside Church identified itself from its beginning as an “interdenominational, interracial, and international religious institution,”  though nominally maintaining affiliation with both the Northern Baptist Convention and United Church of Christ. Fosdick had served since the late 1920s as the senior minister on NBC’s nondenominational Protestant radio program, National Vespers, and his successor at Riverside, Robert McCracken, was a frequent guest on the National Radio Pulpit radio program; from its inception, The Riverside Church had enduring connections to the two flagship radio programs of mainline Protestantism.  

Over the years The Riverside Church engaged in a wide range of local missionary and community service efforts, including ministry programs targeted towards groups such as international students, young businesswomen and men, servicemen, the aged, and others. Riverside called itself a “small town church in the big city,” with close to 3,900 members and 220 employed staff in 1960. Its high church formal Sunday services imbued Riverside with a sense of gravitas, and their interfaith work and engagement in the city’s civic life provided cultural authority. Riverside frequently collaborated with other religious and educational institutions situated nearby in Morningside Heights including Barnard College, Union Theological Seminary, Interchurch Center, and Columbia University. The demographics of the neighborhood were shifting in the late 1950s, with growing numbers of Puerto Rican and Black residents. As an increasing number of Riverside members lived outside the immediate neighborhood in other boroughs and suburbs, radio was seen as a way both to serve the diversifying local community and to knit together a geographically-dispersing congregation.   

A 1954 internal church survey recommended looking into radio and television as new avenues for Riverside to fulfill its mission and meet some of these emerging demographic needs.  In 1956 a specially commissioned committee laid out plans to expand Riverside into radio and possibly television production and update its physical plant for broadcasting. This was followed by a year-long study of a Special FM Radio Committee, led by Francis S. Harmon. A Riverside trustee and former Board of Deacons chairman, Harmon was then serving as vice president of the National Council of Churches and of the Interchurch Center. He had previously been president of the YMCA and worked in motion picture distribution as an assistant to Will H. Hays, head of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, the industry’s organization for self-regulation.
