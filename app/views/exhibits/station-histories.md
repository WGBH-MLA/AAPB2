## Main

Public broadcasting began at the local level, and each public broadcasting station’s history is unique and tied closely to its community.

Many stations started out when the technology, whether radio or television, was new and largely untested. For example, WILL [get quote from Jack’s piece].

In other cases, people decided that public broadcasting was the best way to address a need in their communities. For Arkansas, this occurred at the state level, with the establishment of the Arkansas Education Television Network, which was championed by state politicians. On the other side of the country, Radio Bilingue was created in Fresno, California to provide better information to the Spanish-speaking community there.

Because of their varied histories and communities, each station’s mission is different; however, they are all dedicated to providing quality programming that addresses their audience’s interests and needs.

In this exhibition are some examples of stations setting out on their missions, reaching milestones needed to achieve those missions, and looking back to evaluate how well they’ve accomplished those missions.

Many of the stations participating in the AAPB have well-documented histories, which you can read about on their websites (links to each station’s website are available on their organization page). This exhibition is not trying to comprehensively cover the breadth of public broadcasting’s history, but rather is intended to highlight pieces of audiovisual content, which serve as both documents about and artifacts of specific station’s histories. Each item in the exhibition has captured a moment in time. We’re very lucky that in the midst of producing so much amazing, educational, public-focused, and audience-driven content, these stations also took the time and the pride in their work to document their own histories, so that we can better remember them now.
