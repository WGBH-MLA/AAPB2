## Main

The first type of content I'm interested in including in my exhibition is initial broadcasts. Items to be included in this section include:

-	[First broadcast of WMMT](/catalog/cpb-aacip_138-93gxdb7z)
-	[First broadcast of Radio Bilinque](/catalog/cpb-aacip_375-375tb7ch)
-	[First broadcast of Wisconsin Public Radio on FM](/catalog/cpb-aacip_30-9351d435)
-	[WGBH recreation of their first broadcast](/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-06g1k422)

The second type of content I’m interested in including in my exhibition is dedication ceremonies for public broadcasting facilities. These are interested because they usually feature discussion of the station’s history, but also highlight the importance of the actual space and equipment used for broadcasting. Items to be included in this section include:

-	[Dedication ceremony of Arkansas’ new Educational Broadcasting Facility](/catalog/cpb-aacip_111-21ghx7d6), with speeches from many public broadcasters and politicians involved with getting AETN started. 
-	[Dedication ceremony of the KOCE/PBS SoCaL station](/catalog/cpb-aacip_221-76f1vwh1), with speeches by public broadcasters and politicians, and ends with short interviews with people in attendance. 
-	[Dedication ceremony of the WXXI facilities](/catalog/cpb-aacip_189-56n0319k), featuring an edited video tour of their whole space
-	[Dedication ceremony of the WNED facilities](/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-8380gndb), with presentation of colors and ribbon cuttings. 
-	[Dedication ceremony of Vilas Communication Hall, Wisconsin Public Broadcasting facilities](/catalog/cpb-aacip_30-89281bqr), made up of speeches by many involved, especially those at the University of Wisconsin, where the station is housed. 
-	I might also try to work in including [the announcement made after WGBH fire in 1960s](/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-19s1rwtr) in this section since it is also about facilities. 


The third type of content I'm interested in including in my exhibition is retrospective anniversary specials. Items to be included in this section include:

-	[WILL history of radio, early broadcasting, and the establishment of University of Illinois educational radio](/catalog/cpb-aacip_16-79v15q57), presented on the occasion of WILL’s 75th anniversary (and narrated by Jack Brighton!).
-	[Maine Public Broadcasting Network’s “20th Anniversary Scrapbook”](/catalog/cpb-aacip_245-214mwb7d) - In this program they go through the history of the network by decade. Each portion starts with a montage of very short bits of early programs, with no sound (voice over and music played instead), and followed by a long segment of a conversation between former staff members about the history of the network. 
-	[WBRA’s “Across the Blue Ridge: 20 Years of Public Television”](/catalog/cpb-aacip_85-85n8ptc3) – This program features interviews with many of the founding staff of the station, who still work there 20 years later. They go through the entire history with great anecdotes. The only problem is they use some short clips (most with voiceover narration played on top of any sound from the clip), so I have to check if that’s okay to put online. 
-	[KUT’s “30th Anniversary Dinner”](/catalog/cpb-aacip_402-70zpch1s) – This is a recording of a dinner celebrating 30th anniversary of station. Molly Ivins MCs. She introduces the evening and recognizes special guests. Then the general manager speaks on the history of the station. Then Bob Edwards, host of Morning Edition, speaks about public radio's unique contribution to radio.

I also have come across a few recordings about the Public Broadcasting Act. I need to track them down again, but I think that these would be really interesting to include in their own section.
