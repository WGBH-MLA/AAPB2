# Legislation and Movements

## Summary

## Extended

The movements pertaining to women’s issues  of the 1960s through the 1980s, including the Second Wave Feminist Movement and its opposition, focused on the legal rights of women. This started with the movement supporting the Equal Pay Act, which passed in 1963 and made it illegal for businesses to pay women and men differently on the basis of sex. Second wave feminists also pushed for legislation to expand and protect [reproductive rights (1981)](/catalog/cpb-aacip_507-2n4zg6gr59), such as abortion, birth control access, and maternity leave; the [Equal Rights Amendment (1981)](/catalog/cpb-aacip_507-2z12n50502), which was meant to prohibit sex-based discrimination; and [Title IX (1979)](/catalog/cpb-aacip_507-hd7np1x85m), which specifically prohibits sex-based discrimination in education, all covered here by Newshour’s forerunner, the MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Movements against this legislation and rights were also active and had reservations about the effects of these laws that were covered, most notably Phyllis Schlafly who led the StopERA movement and was also an active member of the Right to Life movement. Members of these countermovements were primarily concerned about what they viewed as the specific rights of women, as Mrs. Schlafly expresses in this [1980 debate with Karen DeCrow on Iowa Public Television](/catalog/cpb-aacip_37-60qrfs38), as well as the rights of the unborn. The movements that formed around these pieces of legislation, along with aggressive campaigning to challenge long-held norms, helped protect the rights that women won for themselves. Though these legislative efforts were not universally successful, as is shown in the failure to pass the ERA, successful legislation and the national response to activist movements for social change had a significant impact on the way women were treated going forward. The expansion of rights made it possible for women to bring discrimination cases to the courts and win, and gave them significantly more control over their own lives.

In addition to lobbying for legislation to create and protect rights for women, many feminists pushed, and continue to push, to change the culture as well. Public advocacy for recognition of women’s rights is documented in many speeches and debates in public radio and television programs, many of which are preserved in the AAPB. The debates, often between women of different viewpoints, as in this [1994 episode of Firing Line with William F. Buckley](/catalog/cpb-aacip_514-np1wd3qw1z), provided  one way for each side to disseminate their message. With appearances on everything from the PBS’ Newshour, such as an episode titled “Who Speaks for Women” with guests including [conservative and leader of the StopERA movement Phyllis Schlafly and Joy Kennedy, an author who felt unrepresented by any of the movements](/catalog/cpb-aacip_507-7h1dj5946z), to Firing Line, as in this [1982 debate about women’s equality](/catalog/cpb-aacip_514-x34mk6680v), women spoke up on their own behalf constantly. As an important part of that conversation, public broadcasting hosted lots of debates between women and was one way for people learned about the issues at stake and both points of view, as well as interviews from well known women. Firing Line, a nationally-distributed series produced between 1966 and 1999 and hosted by William F. Buckley, Jr., invited women on multiple occasions to discuss women’s issues. One example is a 1975 debate between Buckley and the illustrious and long serving Congresswoman [Clare Boothe Luce](/catalog/cpb-aacip_514-x34mk6679c), during which they discussed feminism and the values Congresswoman Luce lived by. Produced by Buffalo’s WNED, Sandra Elkin hosted the PBS series “Woman,” from 1972 - 1977 which examined issues that women faced, including particular issues facing [Native American (1977)](/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-67wm3fxh) and [Black (1973)](/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-59c5b5nr) women. Elkin also talked to Karen DeCrow, the President of the [National Organization of Women](/catalog/cpb-aacip_514-bn9x05z42t) in 1974, a major women’s organization that is still in existence today. Women like DeCrow were frequently found speaking on broadcasts on behalf of their organizations that were lobbying on issues in the news. Local news and public broadcasting covered women’s issues as well. The archive includes local broadcasts of Shirley Chisholm, the first black Congresswoman who made a groundbreaking run at the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972, and Betty Friedan, who wrote *The Feminine Mystique* and is often credited with sparking Second Wave Feminism, giving [commencement speeches](/catalog/cpb-aacip_305-82x3fpr6) at Smith and Mt. Holyoke Colleges from New England Public Radio. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives holds the collection of recorded speeches from the Commonwealth Club of California, including one of [Shirley Chisholm from 1972](/catalog/cpb-aacip_514-bn9x05z42t).

The effect of legislation and cultural changes pushed by feminists was transformative. The rights that women have dramatically increased from what they were a century ago when women won the right to vote. The push for more women in positions of political power, whether appointed to cabinet positions or elected to political office, also helped put women and women’s issues in a more prominent place in the national conversation.
