# Part V.iv.: Interview Subjects: Politicans, Law Enforcement, and State and Federal Officials

10

## Summary

## Extended

The [Blackside](/2-making-television-history#Blackside) crew interviewed politicians, sheriffs, safety commissioners, and government bureaucrats. Some of them had been opponents of the civil rights movement, some were neither strongly opposed to nor supportive of the struggle, and others used politics and the law to advance the cause of racial justice. 

Executive producer [Henry Hampton](/exhibits/eotp/2-making-television-history#HenryHampton) believed that the [southern civil rights movement](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/civil-rights) succeeded in part because it took place within the framework of American liberal democracy. In fact, according to series producer and cinematographer [Jon Else](/2-making-television-history#JonElse), this is one of the [four main arguments](/2-making-television-history#Arguments) *Eyes on the Prize* presents.[<sup>50</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#50) Hampton’s faith in the nation and its governing bodies is reflected in the prominence of the American flag on screen and in promotional material for the series.[<sup>51</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#51)

Some of *Eyes I*’s interview subjects shared Hampton’s opinion of the nation and its system of government. When [Judy Richardson](/2-making-television-history#JudyRichardson) asked [Jo Ann Robinson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-wh2d796b02?start=1505.79&end=1551.67http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-wh2d796b02#at_1508_s) how she felt when the [Montgomery bus boycott](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/liberation-curriculum/create-your-own-classroom-activity/montgomery-bus-boycott) banished [Jim Crow](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/) from city buses, she described experiencing a sense national belonging as a result of being accorded the full rights of citizenship: "It is a hilarious feeling that just goes all over you that makes you feel that America is a great country, and we're going to do more to make it greater."

Others, however, were more critical of the nation, which they felt did not live up to its professed ideals. [Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-7659c6sr1g?start=1319.25&end=1351.55), for example, says that the objective of [Black nationalists](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/black-nationalism) like himself wasn’t just to abolish Jim Crow in the South but to transform America as a whole:

>**On the other side you had, what we would consider to be the non-nationalist forces, they felt… that just enough pressure was necessary to be brought upon the state of [Mississippi](https://civilrightstrail.com/state/mississippi/) to crack it open and make it part of America. There were others here who were screaming on the nationalist front that we're not trying to be part of America. We're trying to change all of America. You understand?** 

Hampton believed the United States was an essentially just country and that racism and inequality were not part of the bedrock of the nation. In contrast, many Black nationalists felt that racial inequality was fundamental to the American system, and some questioned whether it could ever be wholly excised. For Carmichael, doing so would require radical transformation, not just in the South, but throughout the country.

### Public Servants and Segregationists

*Eyes I* begins with the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in [Brown v. Board of Education](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483) and ends with the passage of civil rights legislation in 1965.[<sup>52</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#52) Hampton and his crew understood that these events did not mark either the beginning or the end of the fight for Black rights; however, they are important milestones in the *Eyes* story. The prominence of legislative and political victories in the history of the movement that *Eyes on the Prize* tells suggests Hampton’s faith in America’s governing institutions. This faith extended to many of the nation’s public servants, whose efforts are showcased throughout *Eyes I*.  

One such public servant was [John Doar](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-dr2p55f743), Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division from 1960 to 1967. During his time in the Justice Department, he investigated violations of the [1957 Civil Rights Act](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/civil-rights-act-1957), an important precedent to the [1964 Act](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=97). [Nicholas Katzenbach](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-dn3zs2m30f) was Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel from 1961 to 1962, Deputy Attorney General from 1962 to 1965, and Attorney General of the United States from 1965 to 1966. He later became Under Secretary of State. One of Katzenbach’s most significant contributions to civil rights history was his part in drafting the [Voting Rights Act](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=100).[<sup>53</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#53)

Of course, not all the public officials Hampton and his crew interviewed helped advance the cause of racial justice. The interviews Blackside conducted with the politicians and law enforcement officials who opposed the civil rights fight are among the most compelling, as well as the most disturbing in the collection. Although many of the formerly avowed segregationists Hampton’s crew interviewed are evasive in their interviews, some of them voice troubling ideas rooted in the racist ideology of [Jim Crow](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/). 

Segregationists—and former segregationists—whose interviews appear in this collection include [Joseph Smitherman](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-m03xs5k88f), mayor of [Selma, Alabama](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/selma/); Sheriff [Melvin Bailey](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-4f1mg7gg86), who worked with Commissioner [Eugene "Bull" Connor](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/connor-theophilus-eugene-bull) in [Birmingham, Alabama](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/birmingham/); and Chief of Police [Laurie Pritchett](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-sq8qb9w27j) of [Albany, Georgia](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/albany/). Connor attempted to quell the civil rights struggle using aggressive methods like siccing police dogs on protesters and blasting them with fire hoses. In contrast, Pritchett attempted to outwit civil rights leaders by schooling himself in the tactics of nonviolence. Connor’s and Pritchett’s different strategies are compared in episode four of *Eyes on the Prize*, "No Easy Walk (1961–1963)." 

### The Interviews

Blackside interviewed the following politicians, law enforcement officers, and government officials. This list also includes those involved with the [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP)](https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/alliances-relationships/mfdp/), which challenged the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party delegation at the Democratic National Convention in 1964. Although these activists were not government-appointed or elected officials, they played a critical role in the political history of the civil rights movement, which is why they are included here.
