## Summary

<a name="1"></a><sup>1</sup>Some of the interviews were originally conducted for *America, They Loved You Madly*, a precursor to *Eyes on the Prize*. For more on *America, They Loved You Madly*, see Part II of this exhibit, [*Eyes on the Prize*: Making Television History(/exhibits/eotp/2-making-television-history/).

<a name="2"></a><sup>2</sup> In *Voices of Freedom: An Oral History of the Civil Rights Movement from the 1950s through the 1980s*, executive producer of the series Henry Hampton suggests that he always intended to produce the second chapter of *Eyes on the Prize*: “Because of the difficulty of raising funds, we had to divide this project into two phases,” he writes (xii). In Chapter Four of the online exhibit on the making of the series, however, Rachel L. Martin suggests that the impetus for *Eyes II* came from the success of the series’ first installment. See Henry Hampton and Steve Fayer with Sarah Flynn, *Voices of Freedom: An Oral History of the Civil Rights Movement from the 1950s through the 1980s* (New York: Bantam, 1990) and Rachel L. Martin, “Making *Eyes on the Prize*: In the Public Eye,” in *Making Eyes on the Prize: An Oral History*, accessed May 24, 2020, https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/ford-forum/making-eyes-on-the-prize-an-oral-history/making-eyes-on-the-prize-in-the-public-eye/.

<a name="7"></a><sup>7</sup>Although *Eyes on the Prize* was a popular movement anthem, it predates the classical Civil Rights era. The modern version is an adaptation of an old spiritual.

<a name="8"></a><sup>8</sup> For a discussion of efforts on the right to discredit policies like affirmative action as antithetical to the southern civil rights movement generally and the principles of Martin Luther King, Jr. specifically, see Michael Omi and Howard Winant, *Racial Formation in the United States*, 3rd ed. (New York: Routledge, 2015) and Roopali Mukherjee, *The Racial Order of Things: Cultural Imaginaries of the Post-Soul Era* (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2006). 

<a name="9"></a><sup>9</sup>In some interviews, the subject is stopped by the interviewer when discussion turns to the present-day. Some subjects compare the struggle in the South in the 1950s and ’60s with the fight against apartheid in South Africa; however, such commentary was never used in the series.

<a name="31"></a><sup>31</sup> Carson; quoted in Else, *True South*, 107. 

<a name="32"></a><sup>32</sup> Jon Else notes that "Henry and Steve [Fayer] established early on that they would construct each episode not around abstract themes, but around the emotional surge of one or two big campaigns…” He continues, “This was, after all, prime-time television. There would, for instance, be no filmed exegesis on all the philosophies, strategies, and tactics of nonviolence on the first Freedom Ride, but there would be a filmed *story* about the *practice* of nonviolence on the first Freedom Ride, in 1961.” Else, *True South*, 109. *Eyes I* is a history of the civil rights movement, but it is also a work of narrative documentary filmmaking. Although the series is richly detailed, when the details threatened narrative cohesion, the Blackside crew privileged storytelling over comprehensiveness.

<a name="40"></a><sup>40</sup>Whereas *Eyes I* focuses on the [southern civil rights movement](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/civil-rights), *Eyes II* explores the continuation of the struggle in many of the nation’s cities, from Los Angeles to Boston.

<a name="42"></a><sup>42</sup>Else, *True South*, 96. 

<a name="43"></a><sup>43</sup>According to Else, the *Eyes I* crew rigorously fact-checked all claims made by interview subjects. In the process, they discovered that some of their most riveting stories were simply not true. Else, *True South*, 102-03. The fact-checking process is also addressed in Chapter Three of Martin’s oral history exhibit on the series’ production, Making *Eyes on the Prize*: An Oral History.

<a name="49"></a><sup>49</sup>Jackson’s killing and the Selma to Montgomery march are addressed in episode eight of *Eyes on the Prize*, “Bridge to Freedom: 1965.”  

<a name="50"></a><sup>50</sup>The details of what transpired between Emmett Till and Carolyn Bryant in the Bryants’ convenience store have been debated for decades. For a recent account presenting evidence that Carolyn Bryant lied about her encounter with Till, see Timothy B. Tyson’s *The Blood of Emmett Till* (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2017).





<a name="42"></a><sup>42</sup>Coretta Scott King; quoted in Jeanne Theoharris, “Coretta Scott King and the Civil Rights Movement’s Hidden Women,” *The Atlantic Presents: King*, February, 2018, https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/coretta-scott-king/552557/. King reportedly told journalist Barbara Reynolds, “It was not just a few leaders — it was women ... who really put their mark on history.” Coretta Scott King; quoted in Alia E. Dastagir, “The Unsung Heroes of the Civil Rights Movement Are Women You’ve Probably Never Heard Of,” *Montgomery Advertiser*, February 11, 2018, https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2018/02/11/unsung-heroes-civil-rights-movement-women-youve-probably-never-heard/327829002/.

<a name="44"></a><sup>44</sup>This kind of racist logic is addressed briefly in “Awakenings.” The episode includes a discussion of white supremacy as a system of rules enforceable by violence. One of these rules was the prohibition against Black men looking “too closely” at white women. Later, the episode presents footage of a Klansman warning that integration will lead inexorably to the creation of a “mongrel class of people” and that “both races will be destroyed in such a movement.”

<a name="48"></a><sup>48</sup>Nearly two decades before the 1961 Freedom Rides, Rustin wrote an essay titled, “Nonviolence vs. Jim Crow,” in which he discusses his nonviolent resistance to segregation on a bus ride from Louisville, Kentucky, to Nashville, Tennessee. The essay, originally published in the July 1942 issue of *Fellowship*, is available on the Civil Rights Teaching website, accessed June 6, 2020, https://www.civilrightsteaching.org/traditional-narrative/nonviolence-vs-jim-crow.  

<a name="49"></a><sup>49</sup>Some of the biographical information on the Freedom Riders in this section is derived from the appendix to the book *Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011) by Raymond Arsenault. The appendix can be accessed through the book’s companion website, https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199754311/ 

<a name="50"></a><sup>50</sup>Else writes that the violence of the civil rights fight in apartheid South Africa illustrated for Hampton the strengths of American democracy: “On television we watched the brutal dramas in Cape Town, Johannesburg, and their townships as a ghoulish inverse of the American story, cautionary tales of what could happen to freedom fighters under a fiercely repressive regime in the absence of constitutional protection by their federal government.” Else, *True South*, 99. 

<a name="51"></a><sup>51</sup>The American flag featured prominently in the treatment drafted by Hampton and Steve Fayer for *America, They Loved You Madly* as well. See Else, *True South*, 64. 

<a name="52"></a><sup>52</sup>*Eyes I* also ends with the [Watts riots](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/watts-rebellion-august-1965/), laying the groundwork for *Eyes II*’s focus on the civil rights struggle in the nation’s cities.

<a name="55"></a><sup>55</sup>Many scholars have explored the civil rights movement’s relationship to the media. See, for example, Sasha Torres, “In a Crisis We Must Have a Sense of Drama: Civil Rights and Televisual Form,” in *Black, White, and In-Color: Television and Black Civil Rights* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003), 13-35.  For the authoritative work on the civil rights movement and the press, see Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff, *The Race Beat: The Press, the Race Beat, and the Awakening of a Nation* (New York: Vintage, 2006). 

<a name="56"></a><sup>26</sup>Gene Roberts and Hank Kilbanoff, *The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of the Nation* (New York: Vintage, 2006). Martin Berger is less sanguine than Roberts and Kilbanoff in his assessment of the effects of coverage of the movement by the white press. In *Seeing Through Race: A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011), he argues that in its reporting on the civil rights struggle in the South, the white press portrayed African Americans as pitiable rather than as empowered activists fighting for their rights. He suggests that this portrayal inhibited the movement, especially as the struggle in the South gave way to the rise of Black Power in the latter half of the 1960s.
