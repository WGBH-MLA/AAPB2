### WE DO NOT YET HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THE MOSES WRIGHT IMAGE AS THE COVER

It was important to [Henry Hampton](/2-making-television-history#HenryHampton) that his series not be limited to interviews with civil rights luminaries like [John Lewis](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-8k74t6fv60) and [Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-7659c6sr1g). It was “local people,” to borrow the title of John Dittmer’s book on the civil rights fight in [Mississippi](https://civilrightstrail.com/state/mississippi/), who drove the movement.<sup>37</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#37) Hampton and his crew chose to interview not only the movement’s leaders but also little-known activists and even those on the sidelines of the struggle. Their goal was to tell the history of the civil rights movement from the ground up, emphasizing the crucial role played by unknown, predominantly Black Americans. 

One of these was [Frederick Leonard](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-n58cf9k35x). Before *Eyes I*, Leonard had never been interviewed about his experience on the front lines during the 1961 [Freedom Rides](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/freedom-rides-1961/), which aimed to integrate interstate busing in the South.<sup>38</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#38)  The *Eyes* crew felt that Leonard’s interview was one of the most compelling of the series.<sup>39</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#39)

Several [Montgomery bus boycott](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/liberation-curriculum/create-your-own-classroom-activity/montgomery-bus-boycott) activists spoke to Hampton and his crew. Many of them hadn’t talked publicly about the boycott before. Among them were [Frances Belser](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-7940r9mn52), [John Daniels](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-2j6833nm26), [James Hoffman](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-639k35n267), [Donie Jones](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-jd4pk07v30), and a woman identified only as “[Mrs. Folgate](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-vt1gh9c815).” Women who worked as domestic servants made up a large swath of the rank-and-file during the boycott, which was initiated by the [Women’s Political Council](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/women-s-political-council-montgomery/), led by [Jo Ann Robinson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-wh2d796b02). You can learn more about the civil rights activism of women on the [next page](/exhibits/eotp/5-2-women).

In addition to interviewing ordinary citizens active in the movement, Hampton’s crew sought the perspectives of those whose lives were impacted by the civil rights struggle but who chose not to join the fight. Subjects in this category include [Marcia Webb Lecky](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-wp9t14vm6c) and [Craig Raines](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-nz80k27945), white students who attended [Little Rock Central High School](https://civilrightstrail.com/attraction/little-rock-central-high-school-national-historic-site/) when it was integrated in 1957. [Jan Robertson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-513tt4gd4r), a white student at the [University of Mississippi](https://civilrightstrail.com/attraction/lyceum-the-circle-historic-district-university-of-mississippi/), describes the riots that broke out when [James Meredith](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/meredith-james-howard) was admitted in 1962. [Normareen Shaw](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-cj87h1fd52) was the owner of the café where Alabama State Troopers attacked [Jimmie Lee Jackson](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/jackson-jimmie-lee)’s grandfather, Cager Lee, and his mother, Viola Jackson. The troopers killed Jackson when he tried to defend his family. Jackson’s death prompted civil rights leaders to plan the first of three marches from [Selma to Montgomery](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/selma-montgomery-march) in 1965.<sup>40</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#40)

### Moses Wright and the Murder of Emmett Till

One example of how *Eyes on the Prize* emphasizes the contributions of everyday Americans in advancing the cause of civil rights is in episode one, “Awakenings,” which tells the story of [Moses Wright](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/emmett-biography-moses-and-elizabeth-wright/), the grand uncle of [Emmett Till](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/till-timeline/). Till, a fourteen-year-old boy from Chicago, was visiting relatives in [Money, Mississippi](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/money/) when he was abducted and murdered by two men, J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant. The men alleged that Till had harassed Bryant’s wife, Carolyn Bryant, while buying candy at the Bryants’ convenience store.<sup>41</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#41) They beat him, shot him in the head, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River.

Hampton struggled with the question of how to frame the story of Emmett Till’s murder and his killers’ trial. Instead of focusing on the brutality of the crime, the American public’s reaction to it, or the miscarriage of justice that led to Milam and Bryant’s acquittal, Hampton emphasized Wright’s courage in seeking justice for his nephew. When called to the stand, the prosecution asked Wright to identify the men who came to his home and took Till from his bed the night he was lynched. Despite the danger of accusing a white man of murder in the segregated South, Wright identified Till’s abductors. 

For Hampton, small acts of individual bravery on the part of everyday Black Americans were as critical to advancing the cause of civil rights as protests and legislation. In episode one, “Awakenings,” we learn about the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of [Brown v. Board of Education](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483), which overturned [Plessy v. Ferguson](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/163us537) in declaring segregated public schooling unconstitutional. “I think the greatest impact of the Brown decision was on the Black community itself,” says [Constance Baker Motley](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-3775t3gn95?start=2676.64&end=2880.7), one of a team of lawyers involved in the case. By using this clip from Motley’s interview, “Awakenings” emphasizes the emboldening effect the Brown verdict had on Black Americans. It then introduces Mose Wright’s story, which serves as a bridge between the Brown v. Board verdict and Emmett Till’s murder: “The change began slowly,” narrator [Julian Bond](/2-making-television-history#JulianBond) states. “Blacks in rural areas knew they could lose their livelihood or their lives if they pushed whites too fast. But step by step, the change began, first with small acts of personal courage. In September 1955, an old man named Mose Wright took that remarkable first step.”

Instead of depicting Till’s murder as a setback for civil rights, “Awakenings” emphasizes Mose Wright’s bravery, characterizing his testimony as one of the many acts of courage inspired by the Supreme Court desegregation ruling.
