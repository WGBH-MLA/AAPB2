## Extended

From the [Montgomery bus boycott](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/liberation-curriculum/create-your-own-classroom-activity/montgomery-bus-boycott) to the [Selma to Montgomery march](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/selma-montgomery-march), Black Christianity and the Black church helped mobilize and inspire activists. The movement also attracted people from outside the Black church whose activism was also driven by their faith.

It is “impossible to conceive of the civil rights movement without placing Black Christianity at its center, for that is what empowered the rank and file who made the movement move,” writes historian Paul Harvey.[<sup>57</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#57) Harvey acknowledges the radical secular roots of the movement; however, he maintains that the Black church served both to organize the mass of participants and to provide the ideological underpinnings of the struggle. 

Reflecting on the success of the Montgomery bus boycott in [Mississippi](https://civilrightstrail.com/state/mississippi/), [Fred Shuttlesworth](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-086348h395?start=588.88&end=623.93) told Callie Crossley, “Here in [Montgomery](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/montgomery/), I say, all the elements came together. There was the idea, there was a man [Martin Luther King, Jr.]( https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/martin-luther-king-jr/), then there was God’s power, and all these come together. And then it’s time for a movement.” King himself explained the boycott’s success as the result of divine intervention: “God had decided to use Montgomery as the proving ground for the triumph of freedom and justice in America.”[<sup>58</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#58) 

Black Christianity dovetailed with the ethos of nonviolence. The activists who embraced nonviolence as a principle maintained that by appealing to the souls of their adversaries, they could persuade them of the righteousness of their cause. Moral persuasion was an essential objective of the nonviolent protest advocated by [Mohandas Gandhi](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/gandhi-mohandas-k), who developed the method in his struggle against colonialism and inequality in India. This was one reason media coverage of the movement was so critical. The civil rights activists who followed in Gandhi’s footsteps sought to appeal not only to the immortal souls of their enemies but also to the moral conscience of the entire nation. Coast-to-coast media coverage was one means by which they sought to awaken Americans to the immorality of segregation. Section iii: Organizational Activists discusses nonviolence in more detail.

### The Civil Rights and Tri-Faith Movements

For historian David L. Chappell, “prophetic religion” was at the heart of the movement. Ideas derived from the Old Testament undergirded those of the movement’s leaders. The masses of Black protesters fighting segregation were seized by a religious fervor that, according to Chappell, convinced them that they were not only performing God’s work but also that their victory was preordained. [<sup>59</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#59)   

Outside the Black church, other faith-based communities also contributed to the movement. The civil rights struggle intersected with earlier efforts to promote religious pluralism. In *Tri-Faith America: How Catholics and Jews Held Postwar America to Its Protestant Promise*, Kevin M. Schultz argues that in the 1940s and ’50s, the struggle against prejudice was primarily understood by Americans as a fight being waged by people of faith against religious intolerance. Protestants, Catholics, and Jews came together to foster interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding, and the idea of the United States as an essentially Judeo-Christian nation emerged at this time. Although this paradigm was still exclusionary, it was less so than the earlier, pervasive understanding of the United States as a Protestant nation, which left the largely immigrant communities of Catholics and Jews outside the fold. 

While many of the predominantly white organizations that championed pluralism in the 1940s failed to extend their advocacy efforts to African Americans, this was not universally the case. Some Jewish organizations, for example, moved beyond the cause of fostering religious ecumenism to champion racial equality. [<sup>60</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#60)  Many southern Universalists, Unitarians, and Unitarian Universalists also contributed meaningfully to the movement. Hundreds of Unitarian Universalists took part in the Selma to Montgomery march. Among them were Reverend [James Reeb](http://crdl.usg.edu/people/r/reeb_james_j_1927_1965/) and [Viola Luizzo](http://crdl.usg.edu/people/l/liuzzo_viola_1925_1965/?Welcome); they were both murdered by segregationists for their activism. [<sup>61</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#61)

In his interview, [Orloff Miller](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-qz22b8wb7q) reflects on the involvement of Unitarian Universalists in the campaign in [Selma, Alabama](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/selma/). Miller, along with James Reeb, went to Selma at the request of Martin Luther King, Jr., who issued a telegram requesting that ministers of all faiths come to Selma to take part in the campaign. Miller reflects on the fact that the Unitarian Universalist church was, until that time, “very much removed from the Black community—North or South.” Yet he expresses pride in his church’s role in Selma: “I was, in some ways, quite ashamed of the fact that Unitarian Universalism was not more involved,” Miller says, “but Selma changed all that. Because before we were done with Selma and Selma was done with us, half of our entire denominational ministry was involved.” [<sup>62</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#62)
