# Part V.vi.: Interview Subjects: Church and Religious Leaders

## Summary 

## Extended

From the [Montgomery bus boycott](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/liberation-curriculum/create-your-own-classroom-activity/montgomery-bus-boycott) to the [Selma to Montgomery march](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/selma-montgomery-march), Black Christianity and the Black church helped mobilize and inspire activists. The movement also attracted people from outside the Black church whose activism was also driven by their faith.

It is "impossible to conceive of the civil rights movement without placing Black Christianity at its center, for that is what empowered the rank and file who made the movement move," writes historian Paul Harvey.[<sup>69</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#69) Harvey acknowledges the radical secular roots of the movement; however, he maintains that the Black church served both to organize the mass of participants and provide the ideological underpinnings of the struggle. 

Reflecting on the success of the Montgomery bus boycott's effectiveness, [Fred Shuttlesworth](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-086348h395?start=588.88&end=623.93) told [Callie Crossley](/2-making-television-history#CallieCrossley), "Here in [Montgomery](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/montgomery/), I say, all the elements came together. There was the idea, there was a man [Martin Luther King, Jr.]( https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/martin-luther-king-jr/), then there was God’s power, and all these come together. And then it’s time for a movement." King attributed the boycott's success to divine intervention: "God had decided to use Montgomery as the proving ground for the triumph of freedom and justice in America."[<sup>70</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#70) 

Black Christianity dovetailed with the ethos of nonviolence. The activists who embraced nonviolence as a principle maintained that by appealing to their adversaries' souls, they could persuade them of the righteousness of their cause. Moral persuasion was an essential objective of the nonviolent protest advocated by [Mohandas Gandhi](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/gandhi-mohandas-k), who developed the method while fighting colonialism and inequality in India. This was one reason media coverage of the movement was so critical. Coast-to-coast media coverage was one means by which activists sought to awaken Americans to the immorality of segregation. [Section V.iii.: Organizational Activists](/exhibits/eotp/5-3-organizational-activists) discusses nonviolence in more detail.

### Religious Pluralism and Civil Rights

Outside the Black church, other faith-based communities also contributed to the movement. The civil rights struggle intersected with earlier efforts to promote religious pluralism. In *Tri-Faith America: How Catholics and Jews Held Postwar America to Its Protestant Promise*, Kevin M. Schultz argues that in the 1940s and ’50s, Protestants, Catholics, and Jews came together to foster interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding.

Many of the predominantly white organizations that promoted religious pluralism in the 1940s failed to extend their advocacy efforts to African Americans. However, some did. Several Jewish organizations, for example, moved beyond the cause of fostering religious ecumenism to champion racial equality.[<sup>71</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#71) Southern Universalists, Unitarians, and Unitarian Universalists also contributed meaningfully to the movement. Hundreds of Unitarian Universalists took part in the Selma to Montgomery march. Among them were Reverend [James Reeb](http://crdl.usg.edu/people/r/reeb_james_j_1927_1965/) and [Viola Luizzo](http://crdl.usg.edu/people/l/liuzzo_viola_1925_1965/?Welcome) who were both murdered by segregationists for their activism.[<sup>72</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#72)

In his interview, [Orloff Miller](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-qz22b8wb7q) reflects Unitarian Universalists' involvement in the campaign in [Selma, Alabama](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/selma/). Along with James Reeb, Miller went to Selma at the request of Martin Luther King, Jr., who sent a telegram asking that ministers of all faiths to come to Selma to take part in the campaign. Miller reflects that the Unitarian Universalist church was, until that time, "very much removed from the Black community—North or South." Yet he expresses pride in his church’s role in Selma: "I was, in some ways, quite ashamed of the fact that Unitarian Universalism was not more involved," Miller says, "but Selma changed all that. Because before we were done with Selma and Selma was done with us, half of our entire denominational ministry was involved."[<sup>73</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#73)
