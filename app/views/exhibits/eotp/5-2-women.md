# Part V.ii.: Interview Subjects: Women of the Southern Civil Rights Era

8

## Summary

## Extended

In producing *Eyes on the Prize* and its predecessor, *America, They Loved You Madly*, [Henry Hampton](/2-making-television-history#HenryHampton) and his crew spoke to women who were prominent within the movement. These included [Rosa Parks](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-610vq2sx12), [Diane Nash](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-tq5r786k9m), and [Coretta Scott King](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-542j679j5g). The filmmakers also interviewed some of the women who, as King put it, “made it possible for the movement to be a mass movement.”[<sup>42</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#42)  Among these women were [Frances Belser](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-7940r9mn52), [Rutha Mae Jackson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-xk84j0c05f), and [Vanessa Venable](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-319s17tc0q). Venable, a Black schoolteacher from [Farmville, Virginia](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/farmville/), discusses the closing of the public schools there in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of [Brown v. Board of Education](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483).  

Hampton’s filmmakers also interviewed subjects who were young girls during the height of the [southern civil rights movement](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/civil-rights). In her interview, [Patricia Harris](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-tt4fn11r1s) recounts her experiences with white racism in the South and her participation in the civil rights struggle. [Sheyann Webb](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-9k45q4sc6g) was eight years old in 1965. She recalls meeting [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/martin-luther-king-jr/) with her nine-year-old friend, [Rachel West Nelson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-pz51g0jt61), who also reflects on that day. Webb and Nelson both discuss their involvement in the voting rights campaign in [Selma, Alabama](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/selma/) in 1965. The two women later collaborated with journalist Frank Sikora on the book, *Selma, Lord, Selma*: *Girlhood Memories of the Civil-Rights Days*, later adapted into a made-for-television film directed by Charles Burnett for Disney Studios.[<sup>43</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#43)

Women played key roles in the production of *Eyes on the Prize.* As noted in [Part II](/exhibits/eotp/2-making-television-history) of this exhibit, Hampton valued both racial and gender parity in his production teams; each of the three teams responsible for the series’ first six episodes included one man and one woman, one white and one Black. Women who were not part of these production teams were involved in making *Eyes on the Prize* as well. Hampton recruited former [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)](https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/the-story-of-sncc/) activist [Judy Richardson](/2-making-television-history#JudyRichardson) to work on his earlier project, *[America, They Loved You Madly](/2-making-television-history#Madly)*, and she continued to work with Hampton on *Eyes on the Prize*. Her ties to the movement helped legitimize Hampton’s civil rights film project and persuade other activists to participate. 

One of Richardson’s first interviews was with [Jo Ann Robinson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-wh2d796b02). Robinson was head of the [Women’s Political Council (WPC)](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/women-s-political-council-montgomery/), the grassroots organization that initiated the Montgomery bus boycott. In her interview, Robinson discusses the role of the WPC and of women generally in the civil rights struggle.

### Stories of Rape and Resistance

Both *Eyes on the Prize* and the interviews in this exhibit address the interconnectedness of white supremacy and patriarchy in the segregated South. Episode one of *Eyes*, “Awakenings,” tells the story of the murder of [Emmett Till](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/till-timeline/), lynched for the alleged offense of whistling at a white woman. Journalist [William Bradford Huie](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-2b8v98094z), who interviewed Till’s killers after their acquittal, recounts what one of them told him about his decision to murder Till: “J. W. Milam looked up at me and said, ‘Well, when he told me about this white girl he had,’ and he says, ‘My friend, that's what this war's about down here now,’ he says ‘That's what we got to fight to protect.’ And he says, ‘I just looked at him and I said, “Boy, you ain't ever going to see the sun come up again.” ’ ” 

Fear of miscegenation, or racial mixing, undergirded white racists’ resistance to integration in the South. Men like Milam claimed to commit acts of brutal violence against Black people to safeguard the purity of not only the white but also the Black race. [<sup>44</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#44)  What they really feared, however, was that integration would threaten the unchecked authority of white men over both African Americans and white women. For their part, many white women in the [Jim Crow South](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/) weaponized white patriarchal power to shore up their own relative privilege, falsely accusing Black men of assault, as Carolyn Bryant did to Emmett Till.[<sup>45</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#45) 

The interviews collected here directly address how racialized sexual violence and misogyny upheld white patriarchal power in the South. [Robert Williams](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-5t3fx74m3w?start=522.62&end=1047.93) discusses the attempted rape and beating of a Black woman, Lilly Mae Reed, and the assault of a Black hotel maid named Georgia White, both at the hands of white men. Members of the Black community asked Williams, who was head of the Monroe, North Carolina, branch of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/), if they should seek retribution through violence. Williams recalls, “I told ’em no, that we couldn't resort to that type of thing, because we were operating legally and operating under the law.”

Williams helped ensure that these men were prosecuted; however, both trials failed to deliver justice for either woman. He describes the anger of the Black women in the courtroom following one of the acquittals: “So the black women turned to me in the courtroom, and they said, ‘Now if it hadn't been for you, these men would have been punished, and now you've opened the floodgates on us—they feel now they can do anything to us with impunity.’ ‘So,’ they said, ‘well, what are you going to say now?’” For Williams, this was a turning point: “I turned to them, and I said, from this day forward, we will meet violence with violence. We will enforce our own laws. We will become our own judges, our own juries, and our own executioners.” Williams went on to become one of the most outspoken advocates of what he called “armed self-reliance” for African Americans.

Some of the civil rights movement’s leading activists were at the forefront of the fight against white patriarchal power in the South. Before becoming a household name for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, Rosa Parks helped form the [Committee for Equal Justice](https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/about-this-exhibition/early-life-and-activism/committee-for-equal-justice-for-mrs-recy-taylor/) to raise legal funds for [Recy Taylor](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/obituaries/recy-taylor-alabama-rape-victim-dead.html), a Black woman raped by six white men. [E. D. Nixon](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-ff3kw58917), chairman of the [Montgomery, Alabama](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/montgomery/), NAACP, was also on the frontlines of this struggle. In her interview, [Virginia Durr](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-599z02zv6h#at_622_s), wife of Parks’s attorney and an outspoken supporter of the civil rights movement, discusses the work of her nephew, the lawyer Nesbitt Elmore, on behalf of Black women raped by white men. Durr laments that historians have largely overlooked this chapter of civil rights history. [<sup>46</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#46)

These are not the stories that *Eyes I* tells. The interviews collected here, however, point to the critical, albeit often overlooked, role that Black women and the struggle against white patriarchy played in dismantling Jim Crow.

### The Interviews

The following list identifies the women Blackside filmmakers interviewed during the making of *America, They Loved You Madly* and *Eyes I*.
