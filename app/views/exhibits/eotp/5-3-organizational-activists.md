# Part V.iii.: Interview Subjects: Organizational Activists

## Summary

## Extended

*Eyes I* tells the story of how Black civil rights organizations with different politics and competing ideologies and methods formed a united front in the fight for racial justice. Although personal reflection is at the heart of *Eyes*, [Hampton](/2-making-television-history#HenryHampton) understood that the civil rights movement was not forged by individuals in isolation, but by people working together through their differences toward common goals.

The [Blackside](/2-making-television-history#Blackside) crew interviewed organizational activists from the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/), the [Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/southern-christian-leadership-conference-sclc), the [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)](https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/the-story-of-sncc/), and the [Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/congress-racial-equality-1942/), among other groups. Some of the people they interviewed were prominent within the movement, such as [Fred Shuttlesworth](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-086348h395) of SCLC and [John Lewis](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?f%5Bspecial_collections%5D%5B%5D=eotp-i-interviews&q=John+Lewis&utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5baccess_types%5d%5b%5d=online) of SNCC. Others were not as widely known, and their names are probably unfamiliar to most readers today. One of these men was [Rufus Lewis](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-cn6xw48j9g), who established the East [Montgomery](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/montgomery/) branch of the NAACP. Lewis was also a founding member of the [Montgomery Improvement Association](http://www.montgomeryimprovementassociation.org/), which helped organized the historic [Montgomery bus boycott](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/liberation-curriculum/create-your-own-classroom-activity/montgomery-bus-boycott). 

For Hampton, the uneasy alliance of these groups was an integral part of the civil rights story. *Eyes on the Prize* doesn’t gloss over the disagreements between them; it teases out their details, plumbing what [Jon Else](/2-making-television-history#JonElse) calls the “messy history” of the movement. A generational gulf separated the students of SNCC from some of the older, more staid members of the NAACP; SNCC and CORE members often disagreed with the tactics of the SCLC. And, of course, there were debates and disagreements within groups too. One subject these groups disagreed on was the role of nonviolence in the movement. 

### Differences of Opinion on the Role of Nonviolence

For many civil rights activists, nonviolence was a moral imperative and the foundational principle of the movement. For others, it was a tactic—or rather, a series of tactics, including boycotts, sit-ins, and other forms of direct action—for confronting a powerful adversary like the segregationist state. American civil rights activists were particularly indebted to the form of nonviolence practiced by [Mohandas Gandhi](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/gandhi-mohandas-k) in his civil resistance to British rule in India.<sup>47</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#47)

In her interview, [Diane Nash](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-tq5r786k9m) credits [James Lawson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog?q=james+lawson&utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5baccess_types%5d%5b%5d=online) with importing Gandhian nonviolence to the United States; [Bayard Rustin](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-rr1pg1jj76) and others also taught nonviolent methods of civil disobedience to movement activists and leaders.<sup>48</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#48) In [Fred Shuttlesworth](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-086348h395)’s interview, he suggests that the principle of nonviolence resonated with Christian pacifism, speaking powerfully to [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/martin-luther-king-jr/)’s congregants in [Montgomery](https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/montgomery/), where he was a pastor. Discussing King’s articulation of the principle of nonviolence, Shuttlesworth says, “Dr. King spoke with a new voice. Not only was it a new movement, but it was a new voice, that you must love, you must not hate. The people who hate, or who act like they hate you, you must [love], and the best thing to make out of your enemy is a friend.”

Not all activists ascribed to the philosophy of nonviolence, however. As SNCC member [Hollis Watkins](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-fb4wh2f48v?start=1224.64&end=1302.63) told [Orlando Bagwell](/2-making-television-history#OrlandoBagwell), “As far as the nonviolent question, most of the people from [Mississippi](https://civilrightstrail.com/state/mississippi/) never really accepted nonviolence. You know, we went along with it being a proper tactic at different times here and there, but as far as really accepting it then, none of us really accepted that.”

For Watkins, nonviolence was not a deeply felt principle, and although he recognized its utility as a tactic, he did not think it was useful in all circumstances. SNCC field organizer [Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture)](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-7659c6sr1g?start=380.81&end=501.52) voices a similar view. In his interview, he tells Judith Vecchione about a time when he and local businessman and activist [Amzie Moore](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-bn9x05z20n) were being followed in the town of Cleveland, Mississippi. Fearing for their safety, Carmichael was reassured to learn that Moore had a gun with him, concealed in a brown paper bag. In his interview, CORE member [Dave Dennis](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-xs5j96192c?start=1181.92&end=1242.35) describes civil rights leader [Medgar Evers](https://www.naacp.org/naacp-history-medgar-evers/) as “not a nonviolent person,” noting that he carried a gun in the trunk of his car for self-defense. And as discussed in [Section ii: Women of the Southern Civil Rights Era](/exhibits/eotp/5-2-women/), in his interview, NAACP leader [Robert Williams](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_151-5t3fx74m3w) describes the moment he lost faith in the criminal justice system and his resolve to meet white racial terror with violence. Clearly, some movement activists understood the use of violence as undesirable but necessary for survival.

Although civil rights groups differed both in the methods they used and in the deeply felt principles that drove them, they shared a common goal: the dismantling of [Jim Crow](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/) and other forms of systemic racial inequality. This is why they created the [Council of Federated Organizations (COFO)](https://snccdigital.org/events/cofo-reorganized/), an umbrella group temporarily established in 1961 and reinstated in 1962 by members of the NAACP, SCLC, and CORE. In his interview, SNCC field secretary [Ivanhoe Donaldson](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-151-930ns0mm68?start=393.76&end=640.53) argues that what the media identified as conflicts between organizations were, in fact, merely differences in approach. “SNCC tended to be to the left, as was CORE. NAACP tended to be to the right. But this was a complementary struggle not orchestrated by the leadership, but it’s the nature of struggle in and of itself.” Acknowledging these groups’ differences, he continues, “They all, however, blended into a complementary struggle of what became—what is or was then the civil rights movement.” 

### The Interviews

This section identifies activists who were members of or affiliated with CORE, the NAACP, SCLC, and SNCC. These were not the only groups active in the movement; there were many others—from the [Women’s Political Council](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/women-s-political-council-montgomery/) to the [Lowndes County Freedom Organization](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/lowndes-county-freedom-organization/)—that were also engaged in the fight. The four groups below, however, are the ones best represented in *Eyes I* and the interviews. 

Civil rights groups organized marches, voter registration drives, and demonstrations. This section identifies interviewees' roles in a variety of campaigns, but it focuses on two: the [sit-in movement](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/sit-ins), which helped give rise to SNCC, and the [Freedom Rides](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/freedom-rides-1961/), chiefly organized by CORE. Sit-in activists requested service at whites-only lunch counters to fight discrimination in department stores and other public spaces. The Freedom Riders traveled in integrated groups on commercial buses to challenge segregation in interstate bus travel and in bus station waiting areas.<sup>49</sup>](/exhibits/eotp/notes#49)  The exhibit addresses other important battles in the civil rights struggle in other sections, including the Montgomery bus boycott [(Section vii: Economic and Labor Activists and the Business Community)](/exhibits/eotp/5-7-labor-business/) and the Supreme Court case [Brown v. Board of Education](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483) [(Section viii: Students and Educators, Litigators and De-Segregators)](/exhibits/eotp/5-8-students-educators/).

The lists below identify the organizations with which interview subjects were primarily affiliated. Some of the interviewees assumed prominent positions in these groups after 1965; however, they are only identified here by the roles they played between 1954 and 1965, the period covered by *Eyes I*.
