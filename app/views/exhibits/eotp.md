## Main

Eyes I comprises six episodes charting the history of the [southern civil rights movement](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/civil-rights) from the Supreme Court’s 1954 ruling in [Brown v. Board of Education](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483) to the passage of the [Civil Rights Act](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=97) and [Voting Rights Act](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=100) in 1964 and 1965, respectively. Not every interview the crew conducted was used in the series’ first installment; however, they are all collected here. 

The exhibit does not feature the interviews conducted for Eyes II, which the Film and Media Archive at Washington University in St. Louis is in the process of digitizing. You can access the transcripts of these interviews through Washington University’s exhibit [Eyes on the Prize Interviews: The Complete Series](http://digital.wustl.edu/eyesontheprize/) (click on “Browse Interviews” on the left side of the screen and scroll down to “Series II.”) 

When the digitization project is complete, users will have access to interviews with activists like [Ruth Batson](http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=bat5427.0911.011), who was on the front lines of the fight against segregation in the Boston public school system; [Bobby Seale](http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=sea5427.0172.147), who with [Huey P. Newton](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/newton-huey-p-1942-1989/) co-founded the [Black Panther Party](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/black-panther-party/); and [Jesse Jackson](http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=jac5427.0519.072), the civil rights activist who mounted a historic campaign for the United States presidency in 1984 and again in 1988. These interviews shed light on a period of African American social and political engagement that this exhibit doesn’t address, but that is as much a part of the Black freedom struggle as the [sit-ins](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/sit-ins), boycotts, and marches of the 1950s and ’60s covered here.
