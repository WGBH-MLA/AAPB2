## Introduction

In the mid-1960s, civil rights activists compelled Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The crowning achievement of the civil rights movement, this historic legislation acknowledged and protected essential citizenship rights for African Americans. These acts prohibited segregation and racial discrimination, and eliminated longtime, discriminatory barriers that prevented African Americans’ access to the ballot box. Still, Blacks in the United States continued to experience racism and injustice, as well as economic inequality and discrimination in housing, education, and employment. In this context, some notable civil rights activists started to promote and popularize the concept of “Black Power.” Beginning in 1966, activists, students, politicians, religious leaders, media personalities, and ordinary citizens debated the meaning and merits of Black Power. While the meaning of Black Power continues to be debated, central tenets included wealth distribution or economic equality, anti-imperialism, Black nationalism, and Black pride. Nowadays, Black Power is typically associated with the late 1960s and the rise of the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. However, as this set of sources reveals, the concept of Black Power predated the 1960s and the Black Power Movement was firmly rooted in the civil rights movement.
