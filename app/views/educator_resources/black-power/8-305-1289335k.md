## Introduction

This audio clip is from a press conference held by the Five College Afro-American Society, a consortium of Black students across Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and UMass Amherst. That same morning, Black students from these colleges occupied four Amherst College buildings to bring attention to and protest their inequitable educational experience and opportunities.
