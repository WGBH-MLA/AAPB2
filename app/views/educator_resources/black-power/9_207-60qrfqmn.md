## Introduction

This short radio documentary includes audio clips of Malcolm Xâ€™s speeches and observations of his contemporaries. As a representative of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X rejected the integration and nonviolence politics associated with the civil rights movement. Before his assassination in 1965, however, his views shifted to allow for cooperation across races.
