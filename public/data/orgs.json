    "About": "In 1965, Oregon Educational Broadcasting (OEB), forerunner of Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB), persuaded the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reassign channel 8 from Brookings to Medford. OEB intended to make channel 8 the third station in its television network, which at that time included flagship KOAC-TV in Corvallis and KOAP-TV (now KOPB-TV) in Portland. Southern Oregon was the only region of the state without public television. However, OEB backed out after a protracted battle with several commercial applicants. The license eventually went to Liberty Television, owners of KEZI-TV in Eugene. \nThe owners of the two commercial stations in the area, Bill Smullin of KTVM-TV (now KOBI) and Ray Johnson of KMED-TV (now KTVL), helped a new nonprofit corporation, Southern Oregon Educational Company (SOEC), buy the channel 8 construction permit from Liberty. They also pledged payments of $50,000 once the station signed on. Getting the funds to sign on proved more difficult than expected. With the FCC permit about to run out, KSYS went on the air on January 17, 1977 with the strongest signal of any station in the region, at 191,000 watts. This was still not enough to cover Klamath Falls, and SOEC (later renamed Southern Oregon Public Television, Inc.) immediately applied for another station to cover that region. However, it took 12 more years before KFTS went on the air in January 1989. \nThe two stations are the only public television stations in the state not affiliated with OPB, but occasionally air some of OPB's programs. \nThey are also the \"Presenting Station\" for several national programs including Tommy Emmanuel and Jesse Cook pledge specials.  They also present the series Sierra Center Stage and Music Gone Public.",

    "About": "WJCT went on the air on September 10, 1958, broadcasting a report on educational television from Florida Governor Leroy Collins. Its broadcast reached Live Oak, St. Augustine, Palatka, and Folkston, Georgia. WJCT became Florida's second educational television station, following Miami, and preceding Gainesville's WUFT and Tampa's WEDU by several weeks. WJCT filled its first month with \u201cnational educational television\u201d programs from PBS' predecessor, NET. \nOn April 10, 1972, WJCT added its second media platform, meeting the community's needs for fine arts and music. WJCT-FM went on the air as \u201cStereo 90,\u201d broadcasting music, news and public affairs programming approximately 18 hours a day. Eighteen months later, in October 1973, Channel 7 and Stereo 90 presented their first simulcast, broadcasting a concert by the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra. \nIn May of 2014, the launch of the Digital Convergence Alliance Network Operations Center (DCA-NOC) marked the culmination of work begun four years prior by WJCT Public Broadcasting. WJCT spearheaded a major initiative, laying the foundation for a collaborative venture of 11 public television stations that would not only foster economies of scale but create opportunities to better serve their respective communities, the first of which is the DCA-NOC. A grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) enabled WJCT and community partners to develop a technical plan for the creation of a centralized master control operation. \nThroughout its 56-year history, the First Coast community has been a vital component of WJCT's success, providing individual and corporate support, contributing countless hours of volunteer work, serving on boards, partnering in productions, events and services. With continuing community support, WJCT stands poised to serve the First Coast community for another 50 years, and more, using its unique assets as a resource for citizens to come together to celebrate human diversity, experience lifelong learning, and actively engage in matters of civic importance, all to improve the quality of our lives and our community.",

NJPBA was tasked with promoting \"the intellectual, cultural and civic development of the community by providing a broad range of programs for all ages.\" NJPBA is the FCC licensee of four television broadcast stations and three television translators, which are operated in concert as a statewide network.  \nOver 40 years of broadcasting, the NJPBA, operating under the name of New Jersey Public Television and then New Jersey Network, became one of the nation's top public broadcasting producers of local content. The network developed and produced a live nightly news program, NJN News, along with several award-winning series and specials with a focus on public affairs, covering topics ranging from politics and the New Jersey Statehouse to education, health and medical affairs, environmental issues, youth violence, urban affairs, sports, and business in New Jersey. \nIn July 2011, the NJPBA entered into a Programming and Services Agreement with Public Media, NJ (\u201cPMNJ\u201d), a New Jersey, not-for-profit corporation, to provide public television programming and services on the network under the name of NJTV and online at NJTVonline.org. Today, NJPBA works to ensure that PMNJ continues to provide high-quality, non-commercial programming that serves the needs and interests of the citizens of New Jersey and furthers NJPBA's educational objectives.  NJPBA is also the steward of the historically and culturally valuable NJN program library, which contains an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 media assets that cover 40,000 to 50,000 hours of material.

    "About": "WDVX:  Grassroots Radio \nWDVX Radio came into existence because a like-minded bunch of people around East Tennessee wanted a radio station that represented the culture of the region and celebrated the music that emerged from generations of people swapping tunes and playing on the porch, and its modern evolution.  Cumberland Communities Communications Corporation was incorporated in 1991, the first step in creating the radio station.   \nRadio Station in a Camper \n\nAs happens with grassroots efforts, it was November 1997 when WDVX actually went on the air.  The efforts of a number of passionate people brought a new sound to East Tennessee and the world.  At its foundation were Campbell County native and DJ Tony Lawson (now WDVX Program Director), broadcast engineer Don Burggraf, and a small board of directors that included Appalachian land trust innovator Marie Cirillo. A small, donated camping trailer parked in a campground off I-275 became the station's first permanent home.   \nThe station plays a wide range of music:  Bluegrass, Blues, Gospel, Old Time, Celtic, Alt-Country, early Jazz, classic Country, Cajun, American roots, and on and on.  \nIn 2004, WDVX moved into new studios inside the new Knoxville Visitor Center in downtown Knoxville, and a brand new tradition was born.   The Blue Plate Special, which had been a short set of recorded music in the camper with occasional live performances, developed into a daily live lunch-time concert before a studio audience.  Nowadays the show is 6 days a week, always at noon, and features two acts \u2013 local or touring musicians who provide top entertainment to music fans from around the globe.  \nLive performance is a big part of WDVX programming.  The station also produces a monthly show for kids and kids at heart called \u201cKidstuff,\u201d \u201cFirst Friday Live,\u201d to coincide with the city's monthly arts celebration and \u201cTennessee Shines,\u201d a weekly radio music and spoken word program that originates from a local musical pub.   \nWDVX produces at least three free live concerts in the downtown Knoxville's Market Square each year, and a festival at Ijams Nature Center, a 244-acre park minutes from downtown Knoxville.   \nThe station airs Tennessee Farm Table, a weekly, locally produced program that features area farmers, seed savers, chefs, and food enthusiasts. \nWDVX partners with community organizations throughout the area to promote the arts and culture of the region.

Ownership  of the broadcast license was granted in January 1972, creating a  community-licensed public television station operating under the call  letters KCPT.

    "About": "When KQED went on the air in 1954, it was one of a handful of stations in a new field referred to as the \u201ceducational TV movement.\u201d Conceived initially as a teaching tool, the station quickly broadened its scope to include entertainment and public affairs programming. The young station made a name for itself by airing the famous 1958 Teller-Pauling debate on nuclear fallout as well as controversial inquiries into homosexuality, racial prejudice and communism.  \nKQED originated the idea of selling memberships, staging an annual auction and developing other fundraising methods that became widespread throughout the public television system. \n\nDuring the 1968 San Francisco newspaper strike, KQED founded Newspaper of the Air, public television's first daily news program. Ten years later, KQED, for the first time, broadcasts a full seven-day schedule with the addition of Saturday afternoon programming. \nKQED Public Radio became the first station \u2014 commercial or noncommercial \u2014 to try an all-news format on FM. On August 12, 1987, the station changed format from a classical music station that also aired Morning Edition and All Things Considered to an all news and information station. Two years later, KQED Public Radio becomes an around-the-clock, in-depth news and public affairs broadcasting station on July 1. In 1993, it is the most-listened-to public radio station in the country. \nIn January 1995, KQED publicly launched its website featuring program listings, press releases and content from San Francisco Focus magazine. And five years later, KQED-TV enters the digital age by broadcasting a high definition signal and soon launched five new digital channels: KQED HD, KQED Encore, KQED World, KQED Life and KQED Kids. \nIn 2011, KQED Public Radio becomes not only the most-listened-to public radio station in the nation, but the most-listened-to radio station in the Bay Area. KQED Public Television defies the national curve by increasing viewership, which often places it as the most-watched public television station in America. Usage of KQED's online and mobile services has more than tripled in the past 18 months -- and that was before the launch of the KQED iPhone app. With the development of public media's first radio Pledge Free Stream and the use of social media with thousands of friends and subscribers on Facebook, Twitter and Interactive blogs, KQED's reach continues to expand. That April, KQED rolls out an alternative to the classic pledge drive that April. The Pledge-Free Stream was the first time any public radio station offered members the option of listening on their computers or smartphones without pledge-break interruptions.  \nIn December 2012, KQED entered into an innovative partnership with the Knight Foundation to create Matter Ventures, a startup accelerator and early-stage venture capital fund that supports and invests in media entrepreneurs working to create a more informed, connected and empowered society. \nBy 2014, KQED Public Television stations are often the nation's most watched public television stations in prime time, and KQED Public Radio is the most-listened-to public radio station in the nation. Additionally, KQED's social media has more than 1 million fans across all channels.",

PBS Utah provides service to one of the largest geographic areas of any public television station in the country, reaching portions of five states \u2014 including all of Utah and parts of Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona \u2014 through the use of three broadcast transmitters and a network of over 85 translator relay stations. \nPBS Utah airs national PBS programming in addition to award-winning, locally produced documentaries and series. Recognized as one of the leading public television stations in the country, PBS Utah is committed to serving and engaging with the Utah community through its diverse productions, as well as its educational and outreach programs. PBS Utah is always evolving to provide Utahns with relevant programming and services while maintaining its core values of integrity, fairness, independence, education, and innovation. \nPBS Utah first signed on the air under call letters KUED on January 20, 1958, with an episode of \u201cThe Friendly Giant.\u201d Original broadcasts were set up from improvised studios in the basement of the old student union building on The University of Utah campus. The station had humble beginnings, with the use of primitive equipment, a donated transmitter (thanks to a donation from Time-Life Inc., then-owners of KTVT Channel 4, now KTVX) and a $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation, KUED began broadcasting educational programming for the public in Utah. \nEarly programming was purely educational, in some cases consisting of nothing more than a teacher standing in front of a chalk board and lecturing. Nearly half of the programs aired were locally-produced, with the rest coming from National Educational Television (NET) and other distributors. When the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded NET in 1970, the focus of programming shifted to both education and entertainment. \nIn 1993 the station moved to its current location, the Dolores Dor\u00e9 Eccles Broadcast Center. Moving to this new facility allowed KUED to grow and produce additional programming that previously had not been possible. \nKUED was the first station to ever win the Rocky Mountain Emmy Award of Excellence for the Best Overall TV Station, a major recognition of the station's commitment to serve the Utah community. \nToday, PBS Utah provides four digital channels: PBS Utah HD, WORLD, PBS KIDS 24/7, and Create. PBS Utah HD (7.1 or Comcast 658) offers the full PBS schedule in addition to a weekday block of PBS KIDS programming. WORLD (7.2 or Comcast 390) offers PBS documentaries, public affairs, and more.

    "About": "KRMA-TV (Rocky Mountain PBS) first went on the air on January 30, 1956, as Denver's instructional TV station licensed to Denver Public Schools. As Denver's first educational station, it broadcast for only two hours that inaugural day from a temporary studio in the Emily Griffith Opportunity School in downtown Denver.  KRMA was the 5th TV station to go on air in the Denver metro area and was Denver's first non-commercial station.  It was the 18th educational television station in the country. \nRecords show that as early as 1950, the Denver Public Schools, Denver Public Library, The University of Denver, the Rocky Mountain Radio Council of Denver and the Adult Education Council met to discuss educational television for Denver. In 1952, a community meeting was held to discuss the idea. This followed the FCC's action to set aside 242 channels in the VHG and UHF frequencies for nonprofit educational stations.  In the fall of 1953, the Denver Area Council for Educational Television was established to oversee the work and mission of KRMA for more than 30 years. \nOn May 1, 1987, the Denver Public Schools transferred the license to the Council for Public Television, Channel 6, Inc. Following this decision, KRMA started a capital campaign to raise $14.5 million to move on October 30, 1992 to its current studios in Denver at 1089 Bannock Street. Rocky Mountain PBS continues to be at this location today and has expanded its presence in Colorado by adding two additional studios, KTSC (Pueblo/Colorado Springs) and KRMJ (Grand Junction). \nIn recent years, Rocky Mountain PBS has expanded by merging with [I-News](https://inewsnetwork.org/), a Colorado-based nonprofit that produces in-depth journalism for media outlets across the region and [KUVO Radio](https://kuvo.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/), a jazz, blues and news public radio station. \nRocky Mountain PBS has been on the air for 59 years and will celebrate its 60th anniversary on January 30, 2016. \n\nEach week, nearly 900,000 people throughout Colorado turn to Rocky Mountain PBS to discover inspiring local, national and international programming; find diverse viewpoints; score front row center seats to world-class performances; and experience lifelong learning opportunities.  \nRocky Mountain PBS is now Colorado's only statewide television network, with stations in Denver (KRMA), Pueblo/Colorado Springs (KTSC), Steamboat Springs (KRMZ), Grand Junction (KRMJ) and Durango (KRMU). \n\nThe entire history of Rocky Mountain PBS is being archived by an award-winning volunteer-driven project known as [\u201cStation's Archived Memories\u201d](https://www.rmpbs.org/volunteer/sam/) (SAM).  The archive project was founded in 2000. To date, the dedicated group of volunteers has meticulously collected and digitally archived over 50,000 photographs, 195 Oral History interviews, 15,000 Station documents, 3,500 Memorabilia pieces as well as inventoried 11,500 KRMA/Rocky Mountain PBS productions and digitally preserved 700 local programs.

It premiered May 7 1983, 10:30 PM. Produced by Kaye Lavine, hosted by Hank Troy and directed  by David Ryan.   DVD copies of \u201cGlenarm Place\u201d in the SAM archives.  Performances were simulcast in stereo with KCFR Radio (90.1 FM) \nThe Naturalists - (1973) KRMA's most ambitious project yet was undertaken beginning March 11, 1973.  Titled \u201cThe naturalists,\u201d it is a program about four of America's greatest naturalists:  John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt.  Jim Case,   KRMA's \u201cSpecial Projects Cine Unit,\u201d under the direction of Jim Case, produced the four-hour program series. Case believed the understanding of the work of these four men would be a valuable addition to the life of the nation. The four half-hour programs were produced by KRMA-TV under the supervision of the special projects director, James Case.  The objective of the series, is \u201cto help contemporary society to re-learn the values and laws of nature these men came to slowly and naturally.\u201d To assure accuracy, each shooting script was authenticated by a \u201ccontent authority\u201d--a man or woman who personally knew the naturalist or is an authority on his life and work. \nStateline - (1983) Stateline was a program dedicated to coverage of the Colorado State legislature. \nRocky Mountain Legacy - (premiered in July, 1994) Rocky Mountain Legacy sought out the stories of those who bravely faced the risks associated with any worthwhile endeavor.  Colorado was  populated  in the earliest days, by seekers: people seeking wealth, health or the wide open spaces of the west.  The gold rush days and the tuberculosis epidemic of the 1800s, the growth of the railroad industry in the mountain region and the Great Depression - these were just some of the reasons people were drawn to the Rocky Mountains.  Through journal entries, diaries and interviews,  the hardship and sacrifice as well as the triumph and satisfaction that built both urban and rural communities across Colorado are depicted in Rocky Mountain Legacy.",

    "About": "In 1965, WEMU-FM came on the air as a small student-run public broadcasting program. Eastern Michigan University (EMU) students who were members of the WEMU Broadcasting Guild were responsible for broadcasting scheduled programs with oversight from faculty in the Speech and Dramatic Arts department. In 1977, it became a National Public Radio affiliate with a focus on local news, live EMU sports coverage, and jazz music. Though small in size and signal strength, WEMU-FM has established themselves as a midwest hub for jazz characterized by intelligent and inclusive programming and an educational approach to radio broadcasting.  \nWEMU-FM has a role beyond radio broadcasting as media partners in numerous jazz festivals, most notably as a founding media partner of the Montreux-Detroit International Jazz Festival (MDIJF) that was initiated in September, 1980, in part to show the world there was more to Detroit than automobiles. The largest free-of-charge jazz festival in the United States, MDIJF drew audiences of all cultural, economic, and gender backgrounds. Urban dwellers and suburbanites flocked to Hart Plaza on the banks of the Detroit River to sing, dance, and support local favorites and internationally-known jazz giants. Legends like Marcus Belgrave, Wayne Shorter, Dave Brubek, and Sun-Ra shared the stage with local artists like Paul Keller, Geri Allen, and Pepper Adams. As a founding media sponsor of MDIJF, WEMU-FM station managers and music directors were influential early on, encouraging the Renaissance group to use the MDIJF to elevate the local jazz scene and not just a parade of big names, and were directly responsible for booking, promoting, emceeing and recording the performances of the Detroit festival.(Jim Dulzo, interview by Matt Jones, Beulah, MI, May 7, 2020.) WEMU built the foundation for what has always been central to the The festival's ability to draw on a local lineage of jazz greats like Joe Henderson, Geri Allen, and the Jones Brothers, and balance that with national and international jazz greats, and also younger, up and coming talent.  \nNoting the community-unifying effect of MDIJF on the city of Detroit, WEMU brought that concept back to Ypsilanti in the form of three local jazz festivals - The Heritage Festival Jazz Competition, the Frog Island Jazz Festival, and the Depot Town Jazz Series. These Ypsilanti festivals came to serve as warm-up and wind-down gigs for musicians who were en route to or returning from MDIJF. Sun Ra performed on the Frog Island Jazz Festival stage in Ypsilanti. Linda Yohn, Music Director of WEMU for almost three decades and was also present at almost every jazz festival in Southeast Michigan in the late 1980s through to the early 2000s noted that what is documented throughout all of the WEMU recordings from this time period, and not just those from MDIJF, is a unique display of community sharing that will never happen again. Yohn noted the Detroit talent that would perform at the Freight House to audiences from University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University, and the number of \u2018firsts' for performers that happened at Frog Island and Heritage Fest show the importance of those festivals as a launch to the wider jazz community and for many who eventually played at the MDIJF. \nIn the winter of 2019, the recordings from WEMU-FM were transferred to Eastern Michigan University Archives and added to their existing collection of materials.

    "About": "What began with a hand-me-down trailer house headquarters and television transmitter tower on the edge of Fargo, North Dakota, is now a television and radio network that serves North Dakota, portions of its border states, and several communities in Manitoba, Canada. In service to households in the region for 50 years, Prairie Public is not showing signs of being over-the-hill. Rather, it continues to embrace technological advances in the medium while remaining remarkably close to the same mission it has had from the beginning\u2014to deliver programs that educate, involve, and inspire, without commercial interruption.  \nThe organization was conceived in August of 1959 when a forward-thinking Dr. Ted Donat presided over the incorporation of the North Central Educational Television Association. In July of 1963, after nearly four years of planning and development, the first employee was hired, and North Central Educational Television was about to go live. The Association's first station, KFME-TV (Channel 13, Fargo), aired its first broadcast in January of 1964. \nThat first public television signal was an abbreviated three-hour schedule. Prairie Public's first local production, an English Literature course for Moorhead Minnesota's Concordia College, began in 1965. KFME began broadcasting in color in 1967, the same year President Johnson signed The Public Broadcasting Act.  \nNorth Central Educational Television had a growth spurt in the \u201870s, changed its name to Prairie Public Television, and expanded its broadcast area to include the entire state of North Dakota. In the \u201880s, radio broadcasts were added, and the brand has since changed to Prairie Public. \nPrairie Public is proud of its award-winning television documentaries, including an award-winning series about the history and culture of the Germans from Russia, a series of documentaries in collaboration with the Plains CO2 Reduction Partnership led by the University of North Dakota's Energy & Environmental Research Center, the nationally broadcast \u201cPainting with Paulson\u201d art instruction series, and documentaries about Homesteading, Prairie Churches, the Old Red Trail, Scandinavian Traditions, regional artists and musicians, and many more. \nPrairie Public has embraced new technology, adding web content, social media communications and online viewing and listening. The switch from analogue to digital broadcasting\u2014Prairie Public was the first in the region to do so\u2014allowed for more great programming for schools, more hours of non-violent children's programming for families, and the stunning clarity of high-definition television.

    "About": "KENW-TV first broadcast a black and white TV signal in October of 1968 to Channel 3 on the Portales Cable TV company.  On September 1st, 1974, the station signed on (in color) as a regional public television service broadcasting on Channel 3 from a 1000-foot tower located near Caprock, NM.  This location was a midpoint between the three larger cities in Eastern New Mexico, Clovis/Portales, Hobbs, and Roswell, NM.  For many viewers living on the eastern side of New Mexico, KENW-TV was the third television station that could be received over the air by antenna.  The station was housed in the then newly constructed Broadcast Center on the Campus of Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, NM.   \nWith conversion from analog to digital television in 2006, the Broadcast Center moved into a new state-of-the art Broadcast Center facility located just across Sesame Street Dr. from the old center.  This new center included three TV studios, offices, and facilities for housing KENW-FM.  The old analog TV transmitter was retired and replaced with digital TV transmitters located in the various communities that had been served previously by the old analog transmitter at Caprock.  The main transmitter was located midway between Portales and Clovis.  Additional translators were placed in Artesia, Carlsbad, Fort Sumner, Hobbs, Roswell, Ruidoso, Tucumcari and two on the Mescalero Apache Reservation.  Whereas the old Channel 3 analog signal has only one channel, the new digital virtual Channel 3 has four channels with different programs on each channel, thus providing what amounts to four TV services for KENW-TV over the air viewers. \nThe Broadcast Center shares an educational mission with Eastern New Mexico University. The mission is three-fold.  The first part of the mission is to provide Public Telecommunications services to the university community and the citizens of Eastern New Mexico and West Texas. Local productions help document the interests of those living in this part of the country.  In addition, a broad range of programming is carried on KENW-TV, including instructional programs for primary and secondary schools, outstanding programs that can be used by higher learning institutions in the area, and children's programming, as well as the full Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) for the general public. The public radio schedule includes news and public affairs, classical, jazz, popular music, and a wide variety of both entertainment and informational programs from National Public Radio (NPR). A second and equally important mission is to provide a training center for college students interested in a career in telecommunications. Students from various disciplines in the university use the Center's facilities. They receive training in various aspects of the mass and social media and, in turn, provide a valuable addition to the workforce of the Broadcast Center. Most students work to earn credit and to become proficient in the various skills required of a professional in the mass media. Some of the most qualified students are employed by the Broadcast Center in various operational positions. This prospect for employment becomes a motivational factor for the students who work hard to learn skills that will lead to their employment in the future. \nA third part of the mission is to bring to bear the considerable technical resources and expertise of the Broadcast Center to enhance the total communications efforts at Eastern New Mexico University, using radio, television, and the social media.",

    "About": "The Pacifica Foundation, founded by Lewis Hill in 1947, was given the mission to create a new kind of radio, supported by listeners, owing nothing to sponsors, providing an outlet for creative expression and a safe haven for artistic experiments with the radio medium. Predating National Public Radio by 20 years and beginning in 1949 with KPFA-94.1 FM Berkeley, CA, the network added four stations (WBAI 99.5 FM -NYC, KPFK 90.7 FM Los Angeles, WPFW 89.3 FM Washington D.C., and KPFT 90.1 FM Houston, TX.), over the next 28 years. Perhaps best known as a chronicler of social justice movements and cultural change, the Pacifica stations also embrace the performing and literary arts, offering sometimes the only forum for cutting edge and classical arts, and providing a stage to experiment with radio drama, spoken word, sound sculpture, and the art of radio documentary. \nThe Pacifica Radio Archives were established in 1971, beginning as a repository for station programmers to deposit taped programs of exceptional historic value, appropriate for rebroadcast by other stations, or as \"archival source material\" for radio producers, artists, scholars, and others. The Archives contains over 100,000 program units, 40,000 of which have descriptive records (available at pacificaradioarchives.org), 18,000 of which have been digitally preserved.  The programs date from the advent of Pacifica Radio in 1949 through the present day, the bulk dated between 1955-1985 on the \u00bc inch reel-to-reel format.  This audio history documents the last half of the 20th century and reflects the memory, traditions and evolution of Pacifica Radio. \nThe intellectual content of the collection emphasizes a common thread of social justice covering cultural, health, historical, political, psychological, racial, religious, philosophical and social aspects of our society over a variety of subjects. These include: the McCarthy era, architecture, film history, literature, music, visual arts and culture, Asian- Americans, Indigenous Peoples of the Americas, international affairs, Latin America, the Middle East, South Africa, U.S. intelligence, war, peace, Jews in Europe and the U.S., science and health, women, civil liberties, civil rights, authors in their own words, economics, media, and science.  \nArts programming includes radio adaptations of classic plays and other literary works, original radio dramas, readings of poetry and literature, programs hosted by authors and poets, radio arts, discussions of literature, poetry, drama, sound sculpture, and other genres hosted by artists.  \nThe Archives have been awarded several grants for the digital preservation and improved description of this important collection including grants from The Grammy Foundation, The Ford Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the California Audio/Visual Preservation Project, and our largest grant currently in process from the National Historical Records and Publications Commission. \nThe majority of the collection resides in the temperature and humidity controlled vault at the Pacifica Radio Archives office in North Hollywood, California.

    "About": "The original incorporation documents of the West Central Minnesota Educational Television Company were filed in 1959 as part of a plan for a six-state educational television network to serve the Upper Midwest through a series of linked microwave towers. Appleton Minnesota was identified by the FCC as a logical location for a new link in this network because the station could bring television to this under served rural region and act as a relay point to carry educational television programming via microwave signal to other stations in the network. \nAfter several years of fundraising, the station raised enough federal, state and foundation support to get started.  $22,000 of this support was contributed locally by individuals, businesses, clubs, associations, and churches from Appleton and dozens of surrounding communities. Many of these gifts were $1, $2, and $5 donations from individual families offering what they could afford.  The Alvin Lia family donated 8 acres of farmland to serve as the tower site.   School District 2202 donated its old one-room schoolhouse to hold the television equipment and controls.  A 500-foot tower was erected at the transmission site and on February 7, 1966, KWCM-TV broadcast its first educational program. \nEarly plans called for the station to collect $30,000 a year in operational funds from area schools.  By 1969 however, only 41 schools were paying membership fees.  It was clear that a more sustainable funding model needed to be created.  In 1975, KWCM premiered its first locally developed program. In 1976, PBS and CPB selected Appleton as a site for a satellite receiving ground terminal, giving the station access to a larger selection of programs.  In 1980 the board and management advanced a vision to become more responsive to local people through programs that featured the family farms and small towns of the region. In March 1980, KWCM broadcast its first membership drive.   In a few short years, membership and revenues doubled and soon KWCM had a new home in Appleton's Old City Hall, which was constructed in 1895 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \nIn 1983,  the City of Appleton received a grant to construct a conjoined building for additional KWCM offices and studios. At that time the station was rebranded to be called Pioneer Public Television and in 1985, a new 1,200-foot tower was installed at the transmission site.  In October 1996, a second tower tower and transmitter building was constructed in Chandler, Minnesota and a new sister station, KSMN, began broadcasting. In February 1999, another new Pioneer low power TV signal, K49FA, began broadcasting from Fergus Falls, completing Pioneer's broadcast signal expansion. \nIn  1996, a  new local program, \u201cFuntime Polka,\u201d premiered. The 1990s also saw the debut of  \u201cPrairie Sportsman.\u201d In 2000, Pioneer produced \u201cCountry Spires,\u201d  a documentary about rural churches in the Midwest that was broadcast on public television stations across the country. \nIn 2009 Pioneer began producing \u201cPostcards,\u201d  a weekly magazine program exploring the arts, history and cultural heritage of western Minnesota. In 2013, Pioneer's first Upper Midwest Regional Emmy was awarded to \u201cCaroline Smith: My Way Back Home.\u201d  In 2014 Pioneer was awarded an Upper Midwest Emmy for Haiti Love. \nAs a result of the conversion to digital TV, which was completed in 2010, Pioneer now broadcasts four digital channels to a viewing area that reaches from Detroit Lakes, MN to Rock Rapids, IA.  Through Dish Network and DirecTV, Pioneer's signal can be viewed from western Wisconsin to the Missouri River.  In 2011, Pioneer launched its website www.pioneer.org for online streaming of local programs and PBS content. \nPioneer is currently  advancing plans to construct a new studio, performance space, and office space for the station. Working in concert with the City of Appleton, the proposal is to relocate the City's currently cramped public library to Pioneer's existing 1983 office building. In addition, plans call for a restoration of the historic Opera House so it can once again serve as an active performance venue and community hub. Finally, the proposal calls for the construction of a new Pioneer production and office facility (adjacent to the Old Opera House) that would allow the station to meet the growing need for meaningful content and digital communications infrastructure in the region. \nFrom the \u201cLittle Red TV Schoolhouse\u201d to www.pioneer.org, the West Central Educational Television Company has continued to educate and sustain rural communities through communications services that reflect and uphold local values. Pioneer Public Television is a rare example of how democratic greater-good principles and small town cooperative values have been applied to the sophisticated world of broadcast communications.",

The local community and Howard University supported the station and it grew under its first manager, a commercial broadcast veteran, Arnold Wallace.  WHMM's first anniversary was commemorated with an extravagant gala hosted by comedian/actor Bill Cosby, and attended by notable African American personalities such as boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, and actors Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. \nBy its tenth year, WHUT had produced several award-winning programs with subject matter running the gamut from arts and healthcare to public affairs and athletics. Through this programming, the station developed a brand as a grounded, provocative, and community focused service.  The staff produced diverse programming delving into a multitude of topics affecting the community. It covered religion with Worship in Washington, entertained with Comedy Jam, and offered news, information, analysis and entertainment with Evening Exchange and @ Howard.  In 1995, it televised, live, the historic Million Man March, making the full event available in the over two million homes reached by WHUT's signal. The station also attracted national talent and served as the production center for the nationally televised PBS variety show, With Ozzie and Ruby, which ran from 1981-82 and for The Reading Club, produced and distributed in 1999 by Bryant Gumbel, Renee Poussaint and Alison Davis. \nWHUT has garnered over 14 Emmys and numerous other awards for its programming. \nIn 2010 the station and its staff of 16 completed its digital transition. WHUT is now broadcasting in high-definition and standard-definition. \nIn January 2011 WHUT has extended its broadcast service to the community to a 24-hour, seven day a week presence. \nWHUT plays an active role in the local community with special events and programs specifically geared toward literacy, STEM and early-childhood education.  WHUT has been awarded an American Graduate: Let's Make It Happen community service grant from The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to help Washington, DC improve youth outcomes for all students from preschool through college and onto careers.",

    "About": "The radio station that became WILL first signed on the air on March 27th, 1922 on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The initial call letters were WRM for \u201cWe Reach Millions,\u201d which was likely an overstatement since the station shared its transmitter tube with faculty in the Department of Electrical Engineering. But by the late 1920s, WILL-AM was broadcasting a regular schedule of news, music performances, and programs intended to extend the educational mission of the University of Illinois across the entire state. \nIn 1941 WILL-FM signed on as the first FM radio station licensed to a university. Station engineers wired 20 buildings across the campus to allow live broadcasts of classroom lectures and public events. WILL broadcast many pivotal moments in our nation's history, through the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the tumultuous social changes in the 1960s and 70s. Recordings of many of these broadcasts were preserved in the University of Illinois Archives, and are now becoming part of the American Archive.  \nIn 1951 the newly-formed National Association of Educational Broadcasters began delivering programs to noncommercial radio stations across then United States from Gregory Hall in Urbana, Illinois, the home of WILL Radio. The NAEB network emerged from conferences at the University of Illinois' Allerton House, underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation, which led to a growing recognition of the need for a national system of public broadcasting. In 1961 the NAEB moved its headquarters from the Urbana campus to Washington D.C. to be closer to the campaign to win federal support for creation of a public television and radio system. \nWILL-TV signed on in 1955, broadcasting programs produced by WILL and other educational broadcasters. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, WILL-TV aired a mix of telecourses offered by university departments, along with news, documentaries, and children's programming.  \nWith the signing of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, what had been known as educational broadcasting became part of an emerging public broadcasting system. WILL joined the PBS and National Public Radio networks as they became central points for television and radio program distribution. During the 1970s, programming on WILL Radio and Television became more focused on news and public affairs, as part of the growing national network of professional public broadcasting stations.  \nWith the emergence of the World Wide Web, WILL embraced a new model of multi-platform content production and distribution. With \u201cdigital first\u201d becoming the mantra of the Internet age, WILL has worked to innovate more effective ways of producing and distributing \u201cborn digital\u201d content, while preserving the rich historical record contained in its media archives.",

    "About": "In 1966, an act of the Maryland Legislature established the Maryland Educational-Cultural Television Commission, the governance body of what became known as the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting and, later, Maryland Public Television. Ground was broken for a headquarters and studio facility in suburban Baltimore County's community of Owings Mills on June 5, 1968, and the center went on the air on October 5, 1969.  The founding executive director, Dr. Frederick Breitenfeld, Jr., already a leading figure in public broadcasting at the time of his appointment, served as chief executive for 17 years. \nThe center was established as a nonprofit, state-licensed public television network and member of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).  The state license required statewide reach, and so six towers across the state enabled MPT to get its then-analog signal to all corners of Maryland and into contiguous states and the District of Columbia.  In 1976, the center initiated its first satellite communications project, linking two universities in a law school moot court competition some 22,300 miles in space. \nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of an astounding variety of center-produced historical dramas, how-to programs, nature, and music offerings in addition to educational and cultural programming. It was during this time that several MPT series enjoyed their premieres and what would become decades-long popularity among viewers locally and nationally.  MPT was rewarded for is production prowess with dozens of Emmy\u00ae Awards (four of them national and the remainder regional) along with an impressive list of other major broadcasting honors. \nIn 1984, the name Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting gave way to Maryland Public Television. In 2004, MPT began broadcasting in both analog and digital formats until digital-only transmission started in 2009.  In 2007, MPT introduced V-me, a 24-hour Spanish language channel, which joined MPT's two other digital channels, the primary MPT-HD and secondary channel MPT2, in the daily programming lineup.  \nMPT has been a pioneer in the production, delivery and dissemination of pre-K-12 educational resources and online courses. The award-winning education website Thinkport.org, launched in 2003, offers high-quality lesson plans, digital media, learning games and resources for educators, schools, the child care population, and families.   \nAnother MPT educational endeavor, started in the late 1960s, came out of the State Department of Education's formation of a Division of Instructional Television.   ITV, as it was known, was awarded one-third of the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting's available production facilities, staff, and program schedule. By 1980-81 over 42% of Maryland teachers were using instructional television.  \nIn 1970, College of the Air debuted, as the center became the largest U.S. producer of telecourses for credit. Today, via Thinkport, the platform for learning has expanded to embrace online and mobile technologies, but MPT remains committed to being Maryland's sole statewide educator just as it was in the 1970s and \u201880s.   \nStarting in 2007, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting funded MPT to participate in the the American Archive inventory of public media content. Working on a tight deadline of five months beginning in late summer and finishing in December 2011, an MPT team worked 3,500 hours and was able to inventory almost 48,000 assets. \nToday, under the leadership of CEO Larry D. Unger, MPT's fifth president, some 140 staff members continue to produce award-winning local and national public television programs, to provide distinctive online content and community outreach initiatives, and to offer an impressive array of educational resources for children, teachers, families, and daycare providers across the state and nationally.",

Fitting, given WVPR was Vermont's first public radio station. \nAs a community licensee, Vermont Public Radio operates with a state-wide Board  of Directors and the majority of its funding comes from local community support. \nVPR began broadcasting as WVPR 89.5 from studios in the historic Windsor House  in Windsor, Vermont. In subsequent years, VPR expanded to include WVPS 107.9,  Burlington; WRVT 88.7 Rutland; WVPA 88.5 in St. Johnsbury and WBTN 94.3 in  Bennington, as well as VPR.net. In 2004, we launched WNCH 88.1 FM in Norwich,  our flagship station for VPR Classical, which now covers most of the state. \nAs a state-wide resource, VPR is integral to the journalistic and cultural  life of the region. Listeners are regularly heard on VPR, via call-in  conversations on the daily noon newsmagazine Vermont Edition. Although it may  have grown in size, VPR is still driven by its original mission: to extend  involvement in contemporary affairs through programming that provides context  to the events of today and the impact they have on the lives of Vermonters. \n\"VPR is a living example of what enthusiasm, vision, dedication and long-term  commitment can build,\" says Robin Turnau, VPR President and CEO. \"Together  we've created a resource for the community that connects neighbors across  the state. It's a connection that will only continue to strengthen ....\"",

    "About": "In 1969, just two years after the proposal was first made for a fine arts radio station in Youngstown, Ohio, with the hard work of Don Elser, first director Steve Grcevich, and Youngstown State University president Albert Pugsley, WYSU-FM signed on the air at 88.5 MHZ, licensed to Youngstown State University. The date was October 23, and the time was 10:00 am, with program host Bill Foster introducing Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra.  The station began by broadcasting 12 hours daily from its studios in the former Valley Park Motel on Wick Avenue, and served Youngstown State University and the Mahoning Valley community.  WYSU-FM is a charter member of National Public Radio. Some of the first programs to air were NPR's All Things Considered, WYSU's Folk Festival with Charles Darling, and the syndicated program Adventures in Good Music with Karl Haas.   \nWith a small staff, WYSU made great strides over the next decades, becoming part of the first radio network using satellite-delivered programs in 1971, moving to new studios in 1976, and expanding to a 24-hour broadcast day in 1980.  Also in 1980, WYSU held its first on-air pledge drive, a practice that continues twice yearly, and remains a major source of funding for the station.   \nUnder the guidance of director Robert Peterson in the 1980s and 1990s, the station began airing Morning Edition and operating a new 50,000 watt transmitter.  The addition of translators in nearby Ashtabula, Ohio and New Wilmington, Pennsylvania expanded WYSU's coverage.  In 1996, state of the art digital editing equipment was installed, and overnight programs became automated. \nIn the late 1990s, WYSU collaborated with the McDonough Museum of Contemporary Art at YSU in launching the first Mad About the Arts event \u2013 a celebration of great art, food, music and dance.  The event is now in its 20th successful year of raising funds to support both organizations.  In 2000, classical music host Barbara Krauss planned the first station-sponsored European tour to Great Britain.  The tours have since taken groups of WYSU travelers all over the world.  \nGary Sexton, WYSU's current director of broadcasting, took the position in 2000.  Under his direction, a WYSU website (wysu.org) was established, as well as streaming audio. By 2004, digital equipment was installed in the broadcast studios.  WYSU began broadcasting in HD in 2007, adding an all classical HD channel a year later.  In tandem with these advances, the station continues to produce music and community affairs programs with local hosts and guests.  Fund drives have continued to be successful and the staff and supporting members remain committed to WYSU's mission as a public radio station:  to be the community's leading source for trusted, in-depth news, engaging conversation, and music that stimulates the mind and spirit.",

    "About": "On September 6, 1975 at 11:58 a.m., longtime public television advocate Lucille Woodard flipped a ceremonial switch to sign WLPB on in Baton Rouge. It was the culmination of three years of hard work after the Legislature approved the creation of the Louisiana Educational Television Authority.  \nWoodard, a professor at LSU, started working in the 1950s to get educational television throughout the state. After decades of frustrated efforts, the Louisiana Educational Television Authority was created in 1971 and the money to start the state network was appropriated. \n\nKLTM-TV in Monroe was the second LPB station to go on the air in 1976, followed by KLTS in Shreveport and KLPB in Lafayette in 1978. KLTL in Lake Charles signed on in 1981 and KLPA-TV in Alexandria went on the air in 1983. LPB has also entered into a partnership with WLAE-TV32 in New Orleans, which gives LPB a presence in the Crescent City. \nLouisiana: The State We're In was started in 1976 with current Executive Director/CEO Beth Courtney as host and producer. The only statewide magazine in Louisiana, it has garnered many journalism and public affairs awards during its 38-year history.  \nOur first nationally\u2013syndicated show was Justin Wilson's Louisiana Cooking.  Our 13th series with Chef John Folse, Hook Lies and Alibis, premiered in 2015. \nDocumentaries about Louisiana and its \u201cunique\u201d politics have always been a major part of LPB's locally produced programming. LPB combined with rising filmmaker Ken Burns (The Civil War) to produce Huey Long. Other award-winning documentaries produced or co-produced by LPB have included Uncle Earl and Lindy Boggs: Steel & Velvet. \nThe six-part series Louisiana: A History, LPB's biggest and most lauded project to date, premiered in September 2003 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase.  \nPreserving and showcasing our state's history has always been a goal for LPB. Documentaries such as Signpost to Freedom: The 1953 Baton Rouge Bus Boycott and Against the Tide: The Story of the Cajun People of Louisiana have all explored little-known aspects of our past and present.  \nIn the 1990s, LPB produced a wide range of documentaries about our state's artists, including Ernest Gaines: Louisiana Stories, Frame After Frame: The Images of Herman Leonard, and Kate Chopin: A Re-Awakening. \nWhen Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated South Louisiana and New Orleans, LPB documented the heroic actions of rescuers through Katrina's Smallest Victims and the stories of the storm survivors trying to put the lives back together in American Creole and Washing Away: Losing Louisiana. \nLPB has continued to turn out award-winning documentaries. In 2012 the network was chosen to create the official documentary for the state's 200th anniversary of joining the Union, Louisiana: 200 Years of Statehood.  When a program was needed to kick off the Year of Music in 2013, LPB joined forces with the Lt. Governor's Office and Harry Connick, Jr. to create Sunshine By the Stars: Celebrating Louisiana Music. It featured an all-star lineup of Louisiana musicians performing their unique versions of one of Louisiana's State Songs \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d",
    "Productions": "Louisiana: The State We're In \u2013 Louisiana's only statewide newsmagazine, now in its 38th season.

    "About": "On the air for 47 years, KGLT 91.9fm, alternative public radio in Southwest Montana, has entertained and shared diverse music played by live DJ's around the clock, as well as informative programming and public service announcements, with its listeners.  KGLT is located on the campus of Montana State University (MSU), Bozeman.  With 90 live announcers playing their choice of music 22 hours per day, KGLT produces 1,500 to 2,000 public service announcements and offers three DJ apprentice classes yearly.   Approximately one third of the public service announcements (PSAs) relate to campus offerings such as new classes, recreational and volunteer opportunities, events, and informing students and employees committees and programs in existence to help and protect them: diversity, women's issues, returning vet issues, handicap rights, rape alerts, and drunk driver ride home options. Public service issues on and off campus include AIDS awareness, medical care and preventative options, LBGTQ support, bullying, parenting, and environmental awareness. The KGLT website hosts a Community Calendar that announces lectures, concerts, classes, nature programs, and exhibits in all areas where there are radio signals. Environmentally, Montana is a rare combination of being an \u2018AG' or agricultural state, because of all the ranching and farming, and a state also focused on maintaining its land untainted by industry.  Montana is dependent on the tourist trade for fishing, hiking, and hunting as well as summer and winter recreation.  It is one of the only states making a conscientious effort for a meeting of the minds of the ranchers and outdoors enthusiasts.  As a result, there is a lot of informative and educational discussion offered and shared as PSAs on the air.  \nThe audiences reached are diverse; KGLT ranks in the top 25% of 21 stations in Gallatin County and collaborates with NPR stations in Montana.   KGLT is the matriarch of community radio in the state of Montana, offering openness, inclusiveness, and commitment to community.  The goal for KGLT is to reach more listeners in order to offer them this familial yet professional inclusivity, so that they may benefit from the information and education KGLT provides in music and public service. \nApprentice classes give staff the opportunity to mentor students, helping them to live up to their potential to become informed, comfortable, well spoken, generous, and ethical. \nNew in 2014, KGLT has worked with the Central Washington University radio station to help them build financial support.",
    "Productions": "KGLT is the Emergency Alert System for Gallatin County, broadcasts the daily avalanche and ski reports, announces school closings, and gives a fishing report during the fishing season.  \nKGLT has an on air calendar called \u201cUnzipping the Weekend\u201d, sharing entertainment events and locations.  KGLT informs the public of City and County open forums regarding environmental and planning issues including water quality, building, parks, and development.   \nListener's Personals is a daily report of lost animals, ride sharing, and more, with a trusted reputation for helping people get the help they need.  \nKGLT worked with Superintendent of Schools Denise Juneau, Montana Team Nutrition and first lady of Montana, Lisa Bullock to produce eleven announcements for use by any other station free of charge and posted on the Montana Food Bank Network website.  The aim of the project was to spread information about the importance of breakfast for students' abilities to retain information and learn.  In the interest of students forging ahead to reach their highest potential, a KGLT student employee who is in the Music Technology program wrote the background music and was given credit and recognition for that. \n\nThe Tellin' Ellen program that collaboratively airs on National Public Radio stations in Montana, produced at KGLT, has included the subjects of Depression and Suicide, Mid-life job changes for women, the art of writing, an interview with MSU President Waded Cruzado, the first woman and Latina to hold this influential and important issue in Montana, a discussion about Humane Education with the Director of Education for the Humane Society of the United States and Giving in the workplace (ie.   Workplace payroll deduction options in an interview with the Executive Directors of United Way and Montana Shares. \nKGLT produces \"Chrysti the Wordsmith\", a two minute, 20 year old program exploring the origins and histories of words, phrases and idioms in the English language. The series runs on both National Public Radio stations in Montana: Yellowstone Public Radio in Billings and Montana Public Radio in Missoula.  It also is on KCPW in Salt Lake City and worldwide on Armed Forces Radio and Television Network.  \n\"Montana Medicine Show\", also produced at the station, consists of two minute segments of Montana history and is researched, written and narrated by Bozeman High School Award winning History teacher, Derek Strahn.  It airs six times a week on KGLT and seven times per week on three AM stations in Eastern Montana.  A second book of Medicine Show stories is coming out by summer, 2015 and the series itself will be offered to libraries across the state.  The first, published in 2014 is called The Montana Medicine Show's Genuine Montana History, by B. Derek Strahn, Montana High School History Teacher of the Year.",

Our award-winning documentaries and public affairs programs have addressed many relevant topics \u2012 including financial literacy, healthcare, workforce development and environmental affairs. This broadcast schedule combines with local community outreach programs to focus on developing successful solutions to local issues. \nForty-three years ago WFYI Public Media was formed after many local residents in Central Indiana voiced the need to create the state's first educational television system. A local community leader, Ardath Y. Burkhart, passionately led a small grass-roots campaign to create a local educational television station. This group became affectionately known as \"Ardath's Army\" and quickly gained community support by traveling door-to-door across Indianapolis and its six surrounding counties. The volunteers pushed the station into existence in just a few short weeks by raising enough money to cover a full year of operating expenses. The station first signed on the air with a no-frills staff of nine employees, three black-and-white television cameras, and a signal that reached just beyond downtown Indianapolis. WFYI was the city's first UHF television signal and the only channel to provide commercial-free programming \u2012 a novel idea, even 40 years ago. \nNow, more than 80 professionals work hard at WFYI Public Media to make it Indiana's chief PBS and NPR member station and one of Central Indiana's leading not-for-profits. The WFYI headquarters is a state-of-the-art facility conveniently situated at 1630 N. Meridian St. in Indianapolis. The WFYI location is one of Indianapolis' premier media hubs and centers for civic engagement. \nAs WFYI Public Media looks towards the future, it will continue to focus on expanding its local production capacity; enhancing its community services to both mainstream and underserved audiences; and building on its proven track record of delivering first-rate local, national and international news coverage.",

MPBN's television service is also available in the Canadian maritime provinces and Quebec. \nToday's MPBN is a result of a 1992 merger between Lewiston, Maine based WCBB and Orono, Maine based WMEB.  \nWCBB TV was founded by Colby College, Bates College and Bowdoin College and signed on as the first educational television service in Maine on November 13, 1961. It served the southern and western parts of the state and the studio was based in Lewiston. \nWMEB TV was founded by the University of Maine system and first went to air on October 7, 1963. Among its programs was the \u201cFriendly Giant\u201d and \u201cHistory with Herb Hake\u201d.  In 1964, transmitters are constructed in Presque Isle and Calais bringing educational television to northern and eastern Maine.  In 1974 another transmitter is built to serve southern Maine. This group of stations becomes known as the Maine Public Broadcasting Network in 1971. Based on the University of Maine campus it moves to larger facilities in Bangor in 1987. \nIn 1970, MPBN launched WMEH-FM, Maine's first public radio service. \nWCBB and MPBN collaborated many times over the years but finally merged to form a single entity in July of 1992. After several name changes in the ensuing years, MPBN is chosen to represent both the television and radio services. \nFive television transmitters and seven radio transmitters form the statewide backbone of the transmission system. MPBN television provides one HD and three SD channels in its digital broadcast stream: regular PBS programming with occasional local productions (HD), MPBN Create (SD), MPBN World (SD) and a fourth channel which is used for seasonal coverage of the Maine Legislature (SD).",

PAT was widely acclaimed for its innovative and courageous exploration of subjects ranging from politics and the environment to the role of the media in democracy to the world of ideas. PAT was also a leader within public television in extending the reach of its broadcasts through the creative use of multimedia campaigns aimed at informing Americans of critical issues and involving them in cooperative efforts for the renewing of democracy. <br> <br> The company was founded in 1986 when Bill Moyers left CBS News, where he was senior news analyst for the evening news and chief correspondent for the documentary series CBS Reports. The co-founder was the veteran broadcast journalist Joan Konner. When Konner became dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University in 1988, Judith Davidson Moyers, an educator, corporate board member and creative adviser to the Corporation for Entertainment and Learning, joined the company as president. <br> <br> PAT has produced hundreds of hours of programming for public television, including several groundbreaking series such as Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, A World of Ideas, The Language of Life, The Wisdom of Faith with Huston Smith, Moyers on Addiction, On Our Own Terms (about death and dying in America), Becoming American: The Chinese Experience, Healing and the Mind, and America's First River: Moyers on the Hudson. Among PAT's award-winning documentaries were such investigative reports as The Secret Government, Trade Secrets, Trading Democracy, Free Speech for Sale, Buying the War, Facing the Truth, and Capitol Crimes. For three years beginning in 2002, Public Affairs Television produced the acclaimed weekly newsmagazine Now with Bill Moyers, followed in 2006 by the three-part investigative series Moyers on America, and the seven-part series Bill Moyers on Faith and Reason , the next installation of the weekly newsmagazine Bill Moyers Journal from 2007 through 2010. And, from January 2012 to December 2014, PAT proudly produced his last series Moyers & Company.  <br> <br> PAT closed operations in 2015 and the rights to the company's work were assigned to Doctoroff Media Group.

In 1959, Assignment: The World became the first educational series WXXI produced. More than fifty years later, the program went on to be the longest-running instructional TV program in the U.S., and was offered nationwide until it ceased production in 2013. On September 6, 1966, after a five-year quest for a broadcast license, Channel 21 went on the air, broadcasting 50 hours of programming a week. The following year, Congress established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to promote growth of the industry, which resulted in a consistent funding base for the station. In 1974 WXXI signed on with its all-classical radio station Classical 91.5, and in 1984 it signed on its NPR station on AM 1370. Today, the station owns and operates three television channels (WXXI-TV/HD, Create, and World) and operates cable City 12 in partnership with the City of Rochester. Its radio stations now include: WXXI-AM 1370, WXXI-FM 91.5, plus two HD radio channels and Reachout Radio, a closed circuit 24-hour radio reading service for those who are visually impaired.

    "About": "Today, UNC-TV is the 12-station statewide public television network for North Carolina, reaching all 100 counties with four channels of national and local program content, as well as parts of Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia.  A lot has changed since WUNC-TV in Chapel Hill signed on as the nation's tenth \u201ceducational television\u201d station on January 8, 1955, largely due to the efforts of three visionary leaders.  William C. \u201cBilly\u201d Carmichael, the University of North Carolina's vice president for finance, University alumnus and famous band lead Kay Kyser, and eventual university president William Friday \u2013 then the assistant to the university's president, Gordon Gray \u2013 spearheaded an effort to use the burgeoning power of television to bring non-commercial educational content to the citizens of the state.  This group recognized the unique opportunity when the Federal Communications Commission offered eight channels in North Carolina for non-commercial uses in 1952.  They traveled the state marshaling contributions and support for both public and private funding, and so UNC-TV was born. \nWilliam Friday became president of the university system in 1957, and during his legendary 30 year tenure in that position, he continued to be a powerful and effective advocate for the importance and value of public television.  Gradually, it transitioned from an operation run primarily by students and faculty members to a fully professional broadcasting organization.  With the advent of PBS in 1968, UNC-TV was transformed from the old educational television model to being a source for mission-driven programming for general audiences.  In the meantime, UNC-TV continued to expand its reach, gradually adding transmitter sites to cover more of the state.  In 1979, the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television was established by the university's board of governors, and 10 years later operations were finally consolidated in one location, the network's current headquarters and studios in Research Triangle Park. \nIn many ways, the much-beloved William Friday was the face of UNC-TV.  In addition to his advocacy and leadership as university president, he was also the host of the longest-running program in UNC-TV history, North Carolina People with William Friday.  The program went on the air in 1971 and continued its weekly run until President Friday passed away at the age of 92 in October, 2012.  In a warm and informal one-on-one interview format, Friday engaged North Carolinians from all walks of life, from the exalted to the humble, coaxing out the stories that make every life interesting, and his viewing audience remained loyal throughout his life. In 2014 the Board of Governors of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Nashville/Midsouth Chapter, honored William Friday with posthumous induction as the inaugural member of its Gold Circle for his exceptional service to the advancement of public television.  At the same time, the chapter also presented UNC-TV with its Governor's Award in recognition of the network's history of exemplary service to the state of North Carolina. \nToday, UNC-TV not only brings programming from PBS, the BBC and other sources to the entire state, it produces more than 300 hours of original programming each year for and about North Carolina.  Looking to the future, UNC-TV continues extending its content into the ever-growing array of digital platforms, and expanding its mission to include even more opportunities for public service.",

In the beginning, motivated and eager individuals had a vision: to enrich people's lives through high-quality, non-commercial, educational programming. Institutions like Trinity College and the State of Connecticut supported this goal of reaching out to the community through public broadcasting. \nThe station broadcast its first local children's programming a few weeks after it went on the air, followed a month later by a biweekly local series highlighting the world of arts, entertainment and public affairs in the state. A mobile truck arrived in 1967, color in 1968, auctions in 1972, and pledge in 1973. By 1974, three additional stations across the state had joined WEDH-TV and CPTV was born. The statewide network earned its first Emmy Award in 1977, received its first satellite transmission in 1979, and taped its first national pledge special in 1985. \nThe first public radio station in Connecticut signed on in June 1978, and soon Connecticut Public Radio (WNPR) joined CPTV to form what is now known as Connecticut Public Broadcasting. Initially airing primarily classical and radio music, WNPR now focuses on news and information. Together, the two community-supported, statewide public broadcasting networks are dedicated to serving Connecticut with a mix of educational, news, public affairs, children's and entertainment programming and services.  \nToday, CPTV and WNPR reach the entire state of Connecticut \u2013 an estimated 550,000 television viewers and more than 240,000 radio listeners each week. Connecticut Public Broadcasting is the state's only locally owned media organization producing TV, radio, print and Internet content for distribution to Connecticut's wide-ranging and diverse communities.",

The series was syndicated to commercial and public television stations throughout the country, airing on at least 60 in 1978 and PBS aired episodes nationally in 1981.   \nOpen Air New England / The Faith Middleton Show (WNPR, 1981-Present) - The two-time Peabody Award-winning Faith Middleton Show has been widely recognized for fostering insightful, thought-provoking conversation for more than 30 years. Faith offers her listeners some of the world's most fascinating people and subjects. The show has been inducted into the Connecticut Magazine Hall of Fame as \u201cBest Local Talk Show.\u201d  \nBarney & Friends (CPTV, 1992-2005) - For over a decade, CPTV co-produced Barney & Friends for PBS.

    "About": "Radio Kansas is owned and operated by Hutchinson Community College (HutchCC). Their effort at public service broadcasting began modestly with a 100-watt student station on September 11, 1972 with the call letters KHCC-FM. As the nationwide public radio system grew, the college decided to upgrade the station to a 100,000 watt professional public radio station. On July 1, 1979 this station was inaugurated as the Wichita area's first full-power public radio service with a staff of five in Lockman Hall on HutchCC's main campus. As KHCC grew, citizens from other parts of Kansas began to inquire about how they could get public radio in their areas. By working with groups of supporters in these communities, KHCD-FM, 89.5 MHz, Salina-Manhattan was built and began broadcasting on January 28, 1988. This station serves the north-central part of the state extending to the Nebraska border. On August 3, 1992 KHCT-FM, serving the Great Bend-Hays area was added to the network. It was cumbersome to say KHCC/KHCD/KHCT every time we formally or informally referred to the network, so we knew we needed something simpler and thus the title Radio Kansas was born.",

    "About": "Koahnic Broadcast Corporation was created as a non-profit media corporation in 1992 by Alaska Native leaders to preserve culture and languages, combat widespread misconceptions and prejudices against Alaska Natives, and create cross-cultural bridges. Since our creation, Koahnic Broadcast Corporation has been a national leader in Native American radio broadcasting, media production, and training. \n\nKoahnic operates KNBA 90.3 FM in Anchorage, Alaska, the first urban Native radio station, which signed on in October 1996. KNBA broadcasts news, public affairs and contemporary music to Anchorage and surrounding areas, and streams its signal online. KNBA also produces special programming, such as annual broadcast coverage of the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention that is carried by stations across the state. \nKoahnic is the nation's primary producer and distributor of Native public radio programming. Koahnic's award-winning national radio programs include: Native America Calling, a weekday one-hour live moderated call-in program; National Native News, a weekday 5-minute news feature that has been recognized repeatedly by the Native American Journalists Association; and Earthsongs, a dynamic weekly feature spotlighting contemporary Native music.  \nStarting in 2006, Koahnic has operated Native Voice One (NV1), the national Native radio program distribution service. Through NV1 distribution, Native radio programs reach the majority of the Alaska Native population and the American Indian reservation audience through carriage by most of the country's 55 Native-owned stations. NV1 programs are also heard on public radio stations serving urban areas including Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix, and Sacramento, as well as smaller cities like Duluth, Minnesota; Bloomington, Indiana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Asheville, North Carolina.  \nNV1 station affiliation includes 400 public radio stations and repeaters, including 50 Native stations in rural communities. Many more listeners access the NV1 and KNBA webstreams on mobile devices to hear these shows that are engaging Native America.",
    "Productions": "National Native News (NNN) - a daily five-minute newscast, has been the leading daily news service focused on Native issues for 27 years. NNN is the only news program of this kind produced and anchored entirely by a Native staff.  Broadcast Monday through Friday on more than 300 U.S. and Canadian radio stations and their translators, NNN is anchored and produced by Antonia Gonzales (Navajo), with reporters contributing stories from across the country. \nNative America Calling (NAC) - broadcast live nationwide, is an intense and stimulating one-hour call-in radio talk show. NAC is produced by Koahnic five days a week and broadcast via NV1 to stations across the country. There is no other national forum in any medium for this kind of exchange on Native issues. Native and non-Native leaders in government, business and the arts recognize this and take advantage of the opportunity to participate in NAC's talking circle. Both members of rural and reservation Native communities and Native people listening from urban areas may call in and speak directly to people closest to Native issues. Since 1995 NAC has provided links between Native and non-Native people, enabling callers to speak out on a variety of subjects that educate and enlighten their communities and other public radio audiences. Hosted by Tara Gatewood (Isleta), the program is broadcast on nearly 100 Native and public radio stations and translators. \nEarthsongs - a weekly public radio program produced in Alaska and distributed nationally via NV1. Since 1999, Earthsongs has been the primary showcase for contemporary Native American and Indigenous music and culture. Hosted and produced by Alexis Sallee (I\u00f1upiaq and Mexican-American), the hour-long program is carried by nearly 100 public radio stations across 16 states, and streamed online. Each hour of Earthsongs features exclusive artist interviews, and a carefully curated mix of music by both emerging and established Native musicians.   \nThe Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) Convention is the largest representative annual gathering in the United States of any Native peoples. Each year, the AFN Convention draws between 4,000\u20135,000 attendees. Policy guidelines and advocacy statements are set by the dozens of resolutions passed by voting delegates at the Convention. Since 1996, KNBA has produced and broadcast statewide, gavel-to-gavel coverage of this important three-day event. The broadcasts are aired on KNBA, streamed online, and made available to stations across the state. In the last decade, KNBA has added additional coverage from the event, including daily five-minute newscasts both in English and in Native languages including I\u00f1upiaq, Athabascan, Tlingit and Yup'ik, and a special hour-long discussion program, \u201cAlaska's Native Voice.\u201d KNBA's live, statewide broadcasts from the AFN Convention provide an important service to Alaskans, enabling listeners to stay in touch with important discussions and debates.  \n2010 Inuit Nipaat Radio - Koahnic Broadcast Corporation was the invited United States media provider for the 2010 General Assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) in Nuuk, Greenland. \u201cNipaat\u201d is a Greenlandic and I\u00f1upiaq word meaning \u201cSound,\u201d and the broadcast's title was chosen to reflect the concept that this special coverage had a distinct \u201cInuit Sound\u201d or \u201cInuit Voice\u201d to speak to Native people throughout the circumpolar region. Koahnic provided context, detail and analysis throughout the four-day proceedings with daily broadcasts. As part of the broadcasts, Koahnic produced five-minute recaps of each day's proceedings in English, I\u00f1upiaq, Yup'ik and Greenlandic. The program was aired not only by KNBA in Anchorage, but by rural stations serving communities throughout Alaska including in Dillingham, Nome, Bethel, Chevak, Kotzebue, Barrow and Sand Point.",

Over the last 31 years, with the generous support of state and federal grants combined with private donations the station has expanded its coverage area to reach approximately 85% of Wyoming. To alleviate the confusion of various channel numbers and a multitude of call signs for each translator, KCWC-TV started using the title of \"Wyoming Public Television,\" which more correctly reflected its statewide public television network. On January 1, 2008, after 25 years of service, the station adopted a new name: Wyoming PBS. The station now has 23 full-time staff, with approximately 5 part-time people, providing 2 channels of programming 24 hours a day. \nKCWC-TV/Wyoming PBS was established for the purpose of providing a public television service and distance learning to the citizens of Wyoming. Recognizing that technologies have essentially eliminated time and distance, and created a global village, the Wyoming PBS network seeks to provide a television medium which recognizes the state's unique needs, and which informs, educates and enriches the lives of Wyoming citizens and helps them more fully understand and participate in local, national and global events that affect their lives. The station seeks to balance the differing needs of its citizens by providing a service that is open to public input with program offerings and services built around Wyoming's needs and providing communications opportunities which would otherwise be unavailable.",

    "About": "In 1965, a group of concerned citizens and educators established the Blue Ridge Educational Television (ETV) Association, with the goal of bringing educational television to Southwest Virginia. With seed money from the City of Roanoke and funding from nineteen area school systems, ETV then applied for state and federal grants to build the facilities. Groundbreaking for the studio building took place November 1966. \nOn August 1, 1967, Southwest Virginia's own public television station went on the air for the very first time as Blue Ridge Educational Television, WBRA-TV, channel 15\u2014broadcasting from its new production facility in Roanoke. It was the nation's first all-color educational television station. WBRA's all-color capabilities brought national attention in 1968 when RCA's \u201cBroadcast News Magazine\u201d did an extensive layout about the station. Initially there were no broadcasts on weekends, and the station signed off every weekday at 11 p.m. Within those broadcast hours, WBRA staff were offering an alternative to commercial television.   In addition to broadcasts for schools, WBRA began the tradition of providing quality entertainment programming. \nColor programming was especially popular with educators who were using WBRA broadcasts in classrooms. During the school year, the station aired nearly seven hours of instructional programming every weekday. At that time, the station employed six studio teachers who led the daily televised lessons, which covered subjects such as science, music, geography, and economics. In 1969, instruction and entertainment were expertly combined when \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cMister Rogers' Neighborhood\u201d were added to WBRA's schedule. \nFor the first few years, WBRA's reach was limited to portions of 15 counties surrounding the City of Roanoke. With the addition of two more transmitters, Blue Ridge PBS expanded its coverage area to the farthest corners of Southwest Virginia and into bordering counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and North Carolina\u2014a total of 26,000 square-miles. WSBN in Norton went on the air in 1971, and WMSY in Marion completed the trio of Blue Ridge PBS' stations when it went on the air in 1981. \nToday people travel the world with Blue Ridge PBS, visiting distant destinations as well as special places and people across the Blue Ridge region. Blue Ridge PBS, still community owned, has grown into a 21st century, multimedia organization. It is now the region's story teller, serving 2.5 million individuals as an around-the-clock source for thoughtful news and documentaries, arts and culture programming, and the best in children's television. \nIn recent years, investments in digital technologies have enabled Blue Ridge PBS to triple the amount of programming available to regional viewers. Viewers can now choose from three digital channels: Blue Ridge PBS, Southwest Virginia Public TV and World.",
    "Productions": "Blue Ridge Nightline was a public affairs show that was on the air for over 20 years covering a wide variety of topics.  The show had a number of title variations over the years as hosts changed.  Several episodes of Hake Wheeler's Nightline were part of the collection we digitized for the archives project.    \nBlue Ridge PBS worked with nationally known historian, James I. Robertson, Jr. to produce a 10 part series on the Civil War. \nIn addition, the station produced a 3 hour documentary on Virginia in the Civil War to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the war.  This program was broken down into modules and designed specifically for use in the schools.  A set of the DVDs went to each school in Virginia.",

Channel 8 Television has been on the air continuously since then.  \nOur broadcast service area is the community of Unalaska and the Port of Dutch Harbor, the hub of the Aleutian Islands. Since UCB opened its doors in the 1980s, Unalaska has grown to become the 11th largest community in the state, and Dutch Harbor is one of the top fishing ports in the nation.  Residents turn to our organization for news and information from a trusted local source.  We are the only media organization based in our region, and these days our reach goes far beyond our island.   We are often called upon by state and national news organizations to cover news or provide photos and video from the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands, and Alaska Peninsula.

    "Productions": "Damien - In 1977, PBS Hawaii produced Damien, about a Roman Catholic priest from Belgium who spent 16 years ministering to people with Hansen's disease (leprosy) on Moloka'i. He died from the disease in 1889 and was canonized in 2009. The program was broadcast on PBS stations across the nation and went on to win a Peabody award.  \nSpectrum Hawaii - Spectrum was a long-running series which celebrated the rich cultural and artistic life of Hawaii. In its segments are stories of people who may no longer be with us, and places which may no longer exist, making the program an archival treasure in and of itself. This is why we chose Spectrum for the American Archive digitization project. \nNa Mele: Na Lani Eha - In 2012, for the first time in almost 40 years, television cameras were allowed inside the nation's only royal home, Iolani Palace, to capture performances of music written by Hawaiian royalty performed by some of Hawaii's most beloved musicians. The historic, cultural, and musical significance of this PBS Hawaii special makes it a program that will be cherished for generations to come. \nHIKI N\u014c - Launched in 2011, PBS Hawaii's award-winning flagship educational initiative has exceeded expectations. Through HIKI N\u014c, PBS Hawaii is 1) helping Hawaii's students develop digital media skills, 2) creating a cadre of well-trained digital media teachers, 3) giving a voice to Hawaii's youth from communities rarely covered by the mainstream media, and 4) uncovering a treasure trove of student stories that would otherwise go unheard. At a national conference of foundations this month, the head of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation singled out HIKI N\u014c as one of two exciting youth journalism projects in the country.",

He has produced and directed, written and edited programs for broadcast on public television. Freeman’s documentaries have won numerous awards including a Gold Apple at the National Educational Film and Video Festival, a Certificate of Merit at the Chicago International Film Festival and a Red Ribbon at the American Film and Video Festival. They are in the collection of libraries and universities throughout the country, and have screened at museums including the Weltmuseum (Vienna), Hong-Gah Museum (Taipei), Smithsonian Institute’s National Museum of Natural History, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art (NY).\n\nI make films and teach filmmaking because I believe that motion pictures profoundly shape our attitudes, values and behavior. The images that we create and consume have real power. I am part of a community of filmmakers who act from a belief that the work we do can make a difference.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking is about telling stories. The stories I choose to tell are grounded in the experiences of ordinary people. I make community portraits. Each of my documentaries captures a moment in our shared social history, a fragment of our collective memory in a time of complex challenges and rapid change.\n\nI’ve spent a major part of my career working as an independent filmmaker. On most of my productions I am the producer, director, writer, videographer and editor. I raise the funds, research the material, create the personal connections, shoot, record, structure and edit these films. I create programs that bring grassroots concerns to larger audiences.\n\n[Mad River: Hard Times in Humboldt County](https://markfreemanfilms.sdsu.edu/films/mad-river-hard-times-in-humboldt-county/) is about timber workers in California’s redwood forests.

[Families and Flowers](https://markfreemanfilms.sdsu.edu/films/families-and-flowers/) is the story of growers whose nurseries (and way-of-life) are shadowed by their neighbors’ million-dollar homes. In [Lines in the Sand](https://markfreemanfilms.sdsu.edu/films/lines-in-the-sand/) tidal artist Kirk Van Allyn etches a sacred space with only ephemeral sand drawings.\n\n[Talking Peace](https://markfreemanfilms.sdsu.edu/films/talking-peace/) is a portrait of Jews and Palestinians who are personally engaged in dialogue and peacemaking efforts in San Diego.

    "location": [42.3572, -71.147],
    "About": "WGBH Educational Foundation (GBH) traces its roots back to 1836, when textile merchant John Lowell, Jr. (of the illustrious \"Lowells of Massachusetts,\" one of America's great early families) left a bequest creating \"free public lectures for the benefit of the citizens of Boston.\" In his will, Lowell set aside $250,000, half his estate, to underwrite the public lectures in perpetuity.\n\nIn the early 1940s the position of Trustee of the Lowell Institute passed to Ralph Lowell. Intrigued by the Federal Communications Commission's 1945 announcement that 20 of the 90 radio channels in the newly relocated frequency modulation (FM) band had been reserved for noncommercial stations, Lowell considered a Lowell Institute FM station as a new way to fulfill the institute's mission. Conversations with James Bryant Conant, president of Harvard University, led instead to the notion that Boston-area universities and colleges produce educational programs for broadcast on commercial AM outlets.\n\nIn 1946, the Lowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council (LICBC) was formed--a cooperative venture with six Boston colleges, broadcasting lectures on commercial radio.\nIn April 1951, the WGBH Educational Foundation was formed, to launch an FM station that would carry the LICBC lectures. The \"GBH\" stood for Great Blue Hill, the site of the station's antenna atop a Harvard-operated weather observatory. The incorporators and original board members were Ralph Lowell (as Trustee of the Lowell Institute), the presidents and treasurers of Harvard and MIT, and the president of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nNoncommercial radio station WGBH-FM made its initial broadcast on October 6, 1951: the first Saturday-evening performance of the BSO's 71st season, live from Boston's famed Symphony Hall. The broadcast opened with words of welcome from Ralph Lowell and BSO President Henry Cabot. It was the first full-length broadcast of a symphony concert in Boston in 25 years. Only 15 percent of the households in Greater Boston had FM receivers, but GBH's premiere foray was considered a rousing success. During its first year, WGBH-FM broadcast 2,600 hours of programming--10 times the amount the LICBC had been allotted on commercial radio.\n\nOn May 2, 1955, WGBH-TV signed on for the first time. Its first broadcast was Come and See, a program for young children with folk singer Tony Saletan and Mary Lou Adams from Tufts University Nursery Training School. That was followed by Louis Lyons (a WGBH-FM fixture) reading the news before a camera.\n\nMost early \"Channel 2\" programs were course lectures: French Through Television, Your Income Taxes, From Criminal to Citizen. Over time, GBH made its mark by creating programs locally that were shared with other stations--this prior to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service. Notable among them was Prospects of Mankind, a monthly series in which former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt interviewed statesmen from all over the world.\nIn 1962, GBH produced three programs on French cooking, after a Cambridge cookbook author appeared on a GBH book-review program and whipped up not only egg whites but an interest in how-to television. Within a year The French Chef with Julia Child was teaching audiences in several major cities to cook with courage. \"Educational TV\" had its first national star--and GBH had the first in a long line of productions that would transform American broadcasting and put the Boston station on the map.\n\nIn 2020, GBH announced a new branding, dropping the broadcast-centric \"W\" from its name and adopted a new logo. Going forward, the organization would be known as GBH to recognize GBH's commitment to on-demand and digital-first content for audiences nationwide through streaming, apps, podcasts, social media, educational curricula and virtual events.\n\nToday, GBH is public broadcasting for New England, the number one producer of PBS programming (on TV, the Web, online, and mobile), a major source of public radio content, and a pioneer in both educational multimedia and media access solutions serving millions of people with disabilities.",
    "Productions": "GBH’s best-known television series include Frontline, NOVA, American Experience, Masterpiece, and PBS’ #1 rated\nAntiques Roadshow. A record in award-winning programs for children began in 1972 with Zoom and includes past shows\nsuch as Degrassi Junior High, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, Between the Lions, and FETCH! with Ruff\nRuffman. Current children’s programs include the #1 PBS show for preschoolers (Curious George), the top two ranked\nPBS programs for kids 6-11 (Curious George and Arthur, respectively), and the popular series Peep and the Big Wide\nWorld, Martha Speaks, and Design Squad Nation.\n\nGBH Radio distributes national productions such as The World (co-produced by GBH, PRI, and the BBC), which\nreaches 2.5 million listeners. GBH Radio also serves our local community through analog and digital high-definition\nradio stations, including 89.7 FM and 99.5 FM All Classical. Our radio broadcasts reach over 335,000 listeners weekly,\nand over a hundred thousand more log on to wgbh.org’s live audio streaming each month. In 2012, GBH acquired\nPublic Radio International, whose programs can be heard on over 800 public radio stations.\n\nGBH’s local television productions address the needs and interests of the region through programs like Greater\nBoston (a daily news and public affairs show) and Basic Black (a weekly series focusing on the African-American\nexperience in Boston and beyond). La Plaza, a weekly local program on the culture and concerns of Latino\ncommunities, aired for over 30 years on GBH. A recent addition to GBH’s local line-up is High School Quiz Show,\na televised match-up of competing quiz bowl teams from high schools across the state that is now in its fourth\nseason. In 2012, GBH pioneered a new partnership with New Hampshire Public Television (NHPTV), which will\nstreamline operations and encourage the continued production of thoughtful, community-driven public media."

Many of the announcers are communication students at Southeastern training for careers in the broadcast industry. KSLU strives to serve both the Southeastern and surrounding communities. The station began operation in 1974 as a radio club at Southeastern Louisiana College (as it was known then) operating at ten watts of power. Initially, the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during the weekends and during the holidays. Thanks to support from the Student Government Association and self-assess ed fees of the student body, in 1983 the station qualified for membership in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Since that time the station has increased power to 3,000 watts. KSLU celebrated its 50th birthday on November 11, 2024. The broadcast schedule offers a vast array of non-commercial programs which educate and entertain. KSLU offerings include local talk shows, news, sports, campus, and community activities. KSLU is the station in the local market playing album-oriented classic rock, blues, and Louisiana artists.",

    "Name": "Tom Hayes",
    "About": "Tom Hayes is the son of 'The Round Table' host Harold Hayes. In 1974/1975, when the show was broadcast, Tom was in high school living in upstate New York 100 miles from the WNET transmitter. As such, clear reception of the program was a challenge.  Making his father’s personal collection available here is an honor and a wonderful tribute to his dad’s first foray into the world of television.  It should be noted, prior to hosting 'The Round Table,' from 1963 to 1973, Hayes was Editor-in-Chief of Esquire Magazine, and considered one of the pioneers and main architects of The New Journalism, which gave rise to writers like Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, and Norman Mailer.  Following 'The Round Table,' Harold Hayes, along with Time Magazine art critic, Robert Hughes, co-hosted ABC’s 20/20, the first effort to compete with CBS’ 60 Minutes.  He is the author of several books dealing with wildlife conservation including 'The Last Place on Earth,' 'Three Levels of Time,' and 'The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey,'  which was his last book before passing away in 1989. Tom Hayes has had extensive experience film and TV production including projects with Peter Bogdanovich, CBS Cable, Barbara Streisand, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Carly Simon, Cyndi Lauper, a-ha, and Jermaine Jackson to name only a few.  He has also produced hundreds of TV News magazine stories for the European television market as well as creating numerous promotional and corporate videos.  In 2013, he produced, directed, wrote, edited and narrated a documentary feature film about his father called,  'Smiling Through the Apocalypse - Esquire in the 60s.' The  award winning film was shown in theaters and was short listed for the 2015 Academy Award.  The film is available for streaming on a number of global platforms.",

NOSIDA's focus is to raise awareness about HIV and other infectious diseases through music. Such illnesses are completely preventable, yet disproportionately affect disadvantaged and marginalized populations. NOSIDA received its non-profit status in 2010. Expanding its impact locally, NOSIDA was awarded an FCC license for a 100 watt lower power FM community radio station in 2014. On World AIDS Day 2014, WHIV was officially launched, featuring local music, protest songs, and programming dedicated to human rights and social justice. Our AIM has always been Advocacy through Innovative Messaging. As of 2019, 102.3 FM WHIV-LP features more than 70 hosts and DJs, broadcasting over 12 hours of daily and original content throughout New Orleans, and streaming online in all 50 states and 85 countries worldwide. The majority of WHIV's listeners and supporters are from the greater New Orleans metropolitan area, and all of our shows, music, and content is run by a determined group of local volunteers. Topics on this grassroots radio station range from health as a human right to workers rights to reproductive justice and from Islam in the Crescent City to the Haitian community in New Orleans. There are also many local musicians that showcase a wide array of eclectic sounds. We are WHIV. We honor independent voices. We are human rights and social justice radio.",
