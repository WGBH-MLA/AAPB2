/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/tmp/restart.txt

# Ignore jetty instance
jetty

# IDE
/nbproject/

# Sitemaps built by rake task.
/public/blacklight-sitemap*

# Coverage
/coverage

# ignore link check report
/spec/support/link-check-report.txt

# Chuck ran into gem version issues, which a gemset solved, but if you're ok,
# then it's much more efficient to use the default gemset on all projects.
