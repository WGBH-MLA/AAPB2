    is part of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) collection,
    contributed by the University of Maryland to the AAPB.

    The NAEB was established in 1934 from a precursor organization that formed in 1925.
    In 1951, NAEB established a tape duplication exchange system in Urbana, IL, where
    programs produced by university radio stations across the country were copied and
    distributed to member stations, an early networking scheme that influenced the
    history of later public radio and television systems. The more than 5,500 NAEB
    programs available in the AAPB come from the 1950s and 1960s, and include radio
    documentaries, coverage of events (hearings, meetings, conferences, and seminars),
    interviews, debates, and lectures on public affairs topics such as civil rights,
    foreign affairs, health, politics, education, and broadcasting.
