  history_md: |
    The radio station that became WILL first signed on the air on March
    27th, 1922 on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The
    initial call letters were WRM for “We Reach Millions,” which was likely an overstatement
    since the station shared its transmitter tube with faculty in the Department of
    Electrical Engineering. But by the late 1920s, WILL-AM was broadcasting a regular
    schedule of news, music performances, and programs intended to extend the educational
    mission of the University of Illinois across the entire state.

    In 1941 WILL-FM
    signed on as the first FM radio station licensed to a university. Station engineers
    wired 20 buildings across the campus to allow live broadcasts of classroom lectures
    and public events. WILL broadcast many pivotal moments in our nation’s history,
    through the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement,
    and the tumultuous social changes in the 1960s and 70s. Recordings of many of
    these broadcasts were preserved in the University of Illinois Archives, and are
    now becoming part of the American Archive. 

    In 1951 the newly-formed National
    Association of Educational Broadcasters began delivering programs to noncommercial
    radio stations across then United States from Gregory Hall in Urbana, Illinois,
    the home of WILL Radio. The NAEB network emerged from conferences at the University
    of Illinois’ Allerton House, underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation, which
    led to a growing recognition of the need for a national system of public broadcasting.
    In 1961 the NAEB moved its headquarters from the Urbana campus to Washington D.C.
    to be closer to the campaign to win federal support for creation of a public television
    and radio system.

    WILL-TV signed on in 1955, broadcasting programs produced by
    WILL and other educational broadcasters. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, WILL-TV
    aired a mix of telecourses offered by university departments, along with news,
    documentaries, and children’s programming. 

    With the signing of the Public Broadcasting
    Act of 1967, what had been known as educational broadcasting became part of an
    emerging public broadcasting system. WILL joined the PBS and National Public Radio
    networks as they became central points for television and radio program distribution.
    During the 1970s, programming on WILL Radio and Television became more focused
    on news and public affairs, as part of the growing national network of professional
    public broadcasting stations. 

    With the emergence of the World Wide Web, WILL
    embraced a new model of multi-platform content production and distribution. With
    “digital first” becoming the mantra of the Internet age, WILL has worked to innovate
    more effective ways of producing and distributing “born digital” content, while
    preserving the rich historical record contained in its media archives.

    On September 6, 1975 at 11:58 a.m., longtime public television advocate
    Lucille Woodard flipped a ceremonial switch to sign WLPB on in Baton Rouge. It
    was the culmination of three years of hard work after the Legislature approved
    the creation of the Louisiana Educational Television Authority. 

    Woodard, a professor
    at LSU, started working in the 1950s to get educational television throughout
    the state. After decades of frustrated efforts, the Louisiana Educational Television
    Authority was created in 1971 and the money to start the state network was appropriated.
    

    KLTM-TV in Monroe was the second LPB station to go on the air in 1976, followed
    by KLTS in Shreveport and KLPB in Lafayette in 1978. KLTL in Lake Charles signed
    on in 1981 and KLPA-TV in Alexandria went on the air in 1983. LPB has also entered
    into a partnership with WLAE-TV32 in New Orleans, which gives LPB a presence in
    the Crescent City.

    Louisiana: The State We’re In was started in 1976 with current
    Executive Director/CEO Beth Courtney as host and producer. The only statewide
    magazine in Louisiana, it has garnered many journalism and public affairs awards
    during its 38-year history. 

    Our first nationally–syndicated show was Justin
    Wilson’s Louisiana Cooking.  Our 13th series with Chef John Folse, Hook Lies and
    Alibis, premieres in 2015.

    Documentaries about Louisiana and its “unique” politics
    have always been a major part of LPB’s locally produced programming. LPB combined
    with rising filmmaker Ken Burns (The Civil War) to produce Huey Long. Other award-winning
    documentaries produced or co-produced by LPB have included Uncle Earl and Lindy
    Boggs: Steel & Velvet.

    The six-part series Louisiana: A History, LPB’s biggest
    and most lauded project to date, premiered in September 2003 to coincide with
    the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. 

    Preserving and showcasing our
    state’s history has always been a goal for LPB. Documentaries such as Signpost
    to Freedom: The 1953 Baton Rouge Bus Boycott and Against the Tide: The Story of
    the Cajun People of Louisiana have all explored little-known aspects of our past
    and present. 

    In the 1990s, LPB produced a wide range of documentaries about
    our state’s artists, including Ernest Gaines: Louisiana Stories, Frame After Frame:
    The Images of Herman Leonard, and Kate Chopin: A Re-Awakening.

    When Hurricanes
    Katrina and Rita devastated South Louisiana and New Orleans, LPB documented the
    heroic actions of rescuers through Katrina’s Smallest Victims and the stories
    of the storm survivors trying to put the lives back together in American Creole
    and Washing Away: Losing Louisiana.

    LPB has continued to turn out award-winning
    documentaries. In 2012 the network was chosen by to create the official documentary
    for the state’s 200th anniversary of joining the Union, Louisiana: 200 Years of
    Statehood.  When a program was needed to kick off the Year of Music in 2013, LPB
    joined forces with the Lt. Governor’s Office and Harry Connick, Jr. to create
    Sunshine By the Stars: Celebrating Louisiana Music. It featured an all-star lineup
    of Louisiana musicians performing their unique versions of one of Louisiana’s
    State Songs “You Are My Sunshine.”

    Louisiana: The State We’re In – Louisiana’s only statewide newsmagazine,
    now in its 38th season.  It started in November 1976, a little over a year after
    LPB went on the air. 

    A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse – Our longest
    running cooking show.  It started in 1990.  We’ll be airing the 13th season next
    year. 

    Louisiana: A History – A six-part series produced for the 200th anniversary
    of the Louisiana Purchase in 2003. 

    Sunshine By The Stars: Celebrating Louisiana’s
    Music – We had famous Louisiana musicians cover one of our state songs “You Are
    My Sunshine” in their own styles.  The song was written by our two-term Governor
    Jimmie Davis.

  history_md: |
    Beginning as a tiny 10-watt station back in 1972, KEXP has grown
    over the years into an innovative, influential cultural force in the Seattle community
    and beyond. Some of the station's milestones include:

    1972 -KCMU begins broadcasting
    as a student-run station from a 10-watt transmitter at 90.5 FM atop McMahon Hall
    on the University of Washington campus.

    1981- UW budget cuts mean KCMU becomes
    a community supported, listener powered station.

    1982- Increased wattage (182-watts)
    means listeners hear KCMU outside the University District for the first time.

    1985-
    KCMU forges the musical philosophy and programming focus that defines us today,
    adding hip hop, roots, blues, contemporary global music, reggae, jazz, and more
    to its lineup.

    1986- KCMU moves to 90.3 FM, relocates its transmitter to Capitol
    Hill, and boost its power to 400-watts so that listeners as far as 15 miles away
    can pick up the signal.

    1991- Seattle’s grunge scene explodes and KCMU is there,
    championing local artists, venues, and record labels.

    1999- KCMU partners with
    the UW’s technology R&D team to develop innovative ways to serve more music lovers
    via new media.

    2000- KCMU is the first station in the world to offer uncompressed
    CD-quality audio on the Internet. KCMU moves from its long-time home in the Communications
    Bldg. (CMU) to Kane Hall.

    2001- With the help of venture philanthropy from the
    Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, KCMU becomes KEXP 90.3 FM, moving to its first
    high-tech studios. KEXP nearly doubles its wattage from 400 to 720, serving many
    more people in the Puget Sound, and creates more ways for people across the world
    to enjoy the KEXP experience. KEXP’s UW engineers develop radio’s first real-time
    playlist.

    2002- KEXP launches radio’s first streaming archive. 

    2003- KEXP develops
    radio’s first cell phone stream.

    2004- KEXP.org wins the Webby Award for Best
    Radio Website.

    2005- KEXP offers first live performance podcast.

    2008- KEXP
    teams up with Radio New York to produce Radio Liberation programming for the New
    York airwaves. The programs aired through 2011.

    2011- KEXP renews its collaboration
    with UW for a 30-year term.

    2012- KEXP celebrates its 40th anniversary. KEXP
    partners with Seattle Theater Group and Starbucks to launch the Little Big Show
    concert series with 100% of proceeds from ticket sales benefitting arts-based
    programming and education for Seattle-area youth.

    2013- KEXP partners with the
    City of Seattle to build its New Home at Seattle Center, revolutionizing the way
    contemporary artists and music is championed and nurtured in our community and
    beyond. As part of the iconic local label’s Silver Jubilee, KEXP teamed up with
    Sub Pop and Seattle Center to broadcast from the top of the Space Needle.

    2014-
    KEXP launches live video streaming service, KEXP Now. KEXP YouTube channel reaches
    500,000 subscribers and over 270 million views. UW Board of Regents formally transfers
    the KEXP 90.3 FM broadcast license from its ownership at University of Washington
    to the Friends of KEXP nonprofit. This move helps secure KEXP’s future to champion
    music and discovery for our three beneficiaries: music lovers, artists, and Seattle’s
    vibrant music community.

    2015- KEXP breaks ground on new home at Seattle Center.
    Construction Begins February 2015 on KEXP’s New Home.

  history_md: |
    WYSO Public Radio is owned and operated by Antioch College in Yellow
    Springs, Ohio.  It began broadcasting in 1958 with 19 watts of power.  The student
    founders promised programs “of a nature not generally available,” saying, “this
    will be a community radio station.” They kept their promise.

    Over the next three
    decades, they conducted audio training, collected audio, and made programs covering
    public affairs, international issues, local cultural and political events, lectures,
    poetry readings, concerts, radio dramas and children shows. There was an outpouring
    of programs.  WYSO blossomed.

    Throughout the years WYSO programming has been
    an energetic mix of music and news, both local and national.  

    Today WYSO broadcasts
    with 50,000 watts of power and distributes local and national programs from NPR
    and other sources on multiple platforms.  We are no longer a student station,
    but Antioch College students and community members are still involved.  Alongside
    a staff of twelve, more than twenty weekly volunteers make radio every day.  In
    2009, we revived community training programs and re-established the legacy of
    wide-ranging recordings by community members.  They contribute award-winning feature
    stories, public affairs programs, oral history interviews, and diverse music programs.
    

    CPB’s ombudsman has called WYSO “the little station that could.”  We draw strength
    from our deep engagement with our listeners through concerts, “Listening Parties,”
    open houses and radio production training. Our staff and our community producers
    create programming that reflects the diversity of our listening area in southwest
    Ohio.  

    The WYSO Digital Audio Archives reflects our history as we continue the
    tradition of community involvement. 
  productions_md: |
    Since its beginning WYSO programming has included local news, public affairs, 
    and a variety of music programs. Our archive collection is especially rich in 
    civil rights and social justice issues.  Much of this programming was produced 
    by students and community volunteers. As part of Antioch College, WYSO was 
    present to record many of the musicians, writers, and public figures who 
    visited and spoke on campus, most notably Dr. Martin Luther King’s 1965 
    commencement address.

    Today WYSO continues to produce local news and public affairs and a wealth of 
    music programming created by a mix of staff and community producers.

    The Pacifica Foundation, founded by Lewis Hill in 1947, was given
    the mission to create a new kind of radio, supported by listeners, owing nothing
    to sponsors, providing an outlet for creative expression and a safe haven for
    artistic experiments with the radio medium. Predating National Public Radio by
    20 years and beginning in 1949 with KPFA-94.1 FM Berkeley, CA, the network added
    four stations (WBAI 99.5 FM -NYC, KPFK 90.7 FM Los Angeles, WPFW 89.3 FM Washington
    D.C., and KPFT 90.1 FM Houston, TX.), over the next 28 years. Perhaps best known
    as a chronicler of social justice movements and cultural change, the Pacifica
    stations also embrace the performing and literary arts, offering sometimes the
    only forum for cutting edge and classical arts, and providing a stage to experiment
    with radio drama, spoken word, sound sculpture, and the art of radio documentary.

    The
    Pacifica Radio Archives were established in 1971, beginning as a repository for
    station programmers to deposit taped programs of exceptional historic value, appropriate
    for rebroadcast by other stations, or as "archival source material" for radio
    producers, artists, scholars, and others. The Archives contains over 100,000 program
    units, 40,000 of which have descriptive records (available at pacificaradioarchives.org),
    18,000 of which have been digitally preserved.  The programs date from the advent
    of Pacifica Radio in 1949 through the present day, the bulk dated between 1955-1985
    on the ¼ inch reel-to-reel format.  This audio history documents the last half
    of the 20th century,(removed)and reflects the memory, traditions and evolution
    of Pacifica Radio.

    The intellectual content of the collection emphasizes a common
    thread of social justice covering cultural, health, historical, political, psychological,
    racial, religious, philosophical and social aspects of our society over a variety
    of subjects. These include: the McCarthy era, architecture, film history, literature,
    music, visual arts and culture, Asian- Americans, Indigenous Peoples of the Americas,
    international affairs, Latin America, the Middle East, South Africa, U.S. intelligence,
    war, peace, Jews in Europe and the U.S., science and health, women, civil liberties,
    civil rights, authors in their own words, economics, media, science. 

    Arts programming
    includes radio adaptations of classic plays and other literary works, original
    radio dramas, readings of poetry and literature, programs hosted by authors and
    poets, radio arts, discussions of literature, poetry, drama, sound sculpture,
    and other genres hosted by artists. 

    The Archives have been awarded several grants
    for the digital preservation and improved description of this important collection
    including grants from The Grammy Foundation, The Ford Foundation, The National
    Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the California
    Audio/Visual Preservation Project, and our largest grant currently in process
    from the National Historical Records and Publications Commission.

    The majority
    of the collection resides in the temperature and humidity controlled vault at
    the Pacifica Radio Archives office in North Hollywood, California.  Please contact

    Vermont PBS is Vermont’s statewide PBS affiliate and public media provider, 
    offering viewers the best of PBS, along with a regular line-up of award-winning 
    local programs. Along with serving the entire state of Vermont, Vermont PBS’ 
    broadcast can also be seen in adjoining regions of New York, New Hampshire 
    and Massachusetts, as well as southern Quebec and the Montreal area.

    Vermont PBS programs, and our wide variety of non-broadcast services and activities, 
    are dedicated to improving the lives of our viewers by fostering: increased 
    understanding of one another; improved educational opportunities for children 
    and adults; cultural enrichment; community involvement; and environmental appreciation.

    Programming on Vermont PBS includes renowned PBS children’s programs such 
    “Sesame Street” and “Arthur.” Programming for adults includes such PBS stalwarts 
    as “Masterpiece,” “Nova,” “American Experience” and “Antiques Roadshow,” as 
    well as a Saturday night line-up of popular British comedy programs. In addition, 
    Vermont PBS regularly produces local programs such as “Vermont This Week,” 
    “Outdoor Journal” and live call-in shows with our elected representatives, 
    along with an ever-growing library of historical documentaries that help to 
    keep Vermont history and culture alive. We also regularly produce web-only 
    content such as the 2014-15 online series, “Makin’ Friends With Ryan Miller."

    Historical documentary highlights over the years have included the “Vermont 
    Memories” series (three films highlighting different eras), “Northern Railroads,” 
    “Champlain: The Lake Between,” “Little Jerusalem” (chronicling Burlington, 
    Vermont’s original Jewish settlement) and “Brothers of The Gut: 50 Years of 
    UVM Hockey.” The station maintains a rich library of films documenting the 
    state’s history, and regularly airs historical films from local filmmakers.

    Vermont PBS went on the air as Vermont ETV on Oct. 16, 1967. In 1998, the 
    station changed its name to Vermont Public Television. The station’s 
    transition to fully digital broadcast was completed in 2006 with the digital 
    conversion of its fourth transmission tower. Another rebranding followed in 
    2014 when the station became Vermont PBS. Also in 2014, the station launched 
    a second HD channel, Vermont PBS PLUS, which allows even more opportunity for 
    alternative programming and local content from independent filmmakers.

    KRMA-TV (Rocky Mountain PBS) first went on the air on January 30,
    1956, as Denver’s instructional TV station licensed to Denver Public Schools.
    As Denver’s first educational station, it broadcast for only two hours that
    inaugural day from a temporary studio in the Emily Griffith Opportunity School
    in downtown Denver.  KRMA was the 5th TV station to go on air in the Denver metro
    area and was Denver’s first non-commercial station.  It was the 18th educational
    television station in the country.

    Records show that as early as 1950, the Denver
    Public Schools, Denver Public Library, The University of Denver, the Rocky Mountain
    Radio Council of Denver and the Adult Education Council met to discuss educational
    television for Denver. In 1952, a community meeting was held to discuss the idea.
    This followed the FCC’s action to set aside 242 channels in the VHG and UHF
    frequencies for nonprofit educational stations.  In the fall of 1953, the Denver
    Area Council for Educational Television was established to oversee the work and
    mission of KRMA for more than 30 years.

    On May 1, 1987, the Denver Public Schools
    transferred the license to the Council for Public Television, Channel 6, Inc.
    Following this decision, KRMA started a capital campaign to raise $14.5 million
    to move on October 30, 1992 to its current studios in Denver at 1089 Bannock Street.
    Rocky Mountain PBS continues to be at this location today and has expanded its
    presence in Colorado by adding two additional studios, KTSC (Pueblo/Colorado Springs)
    and KRMJ (Grand Junction).

    In recent years, Rocky Mountain PBS has expanded by
    merging with [I-News](http://inewsnetwork.org/), a Colorado-based nonprofit that
    produces in-depth journalism for media outlets across the region and [KUVO Radio](http://kuvo.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/),
    a jazz, blues and news public radio station.

    Rocky Mountain PBS has been on the
    air for 59 years and will celebrate its 60th anniversary on January 30, 2016.
    

    Each week, nearly 900,000 people throughout Colorado turn to Rocky Mountain
    PBS to discover inspiring local, national and international programming; find
    diverse viewpoints; score front row center seats to world-class performances;
    and experience lifelong learning opportunities. 

    Rocky Mountain PBS is now Colorado’s
    only statewide television network, with stations in Denver (KRMA), Pueblo/Colorado
    Springs (KTSC), Steamboat Springs (KRMZ), Grand Junction (KRMJ) and Durango (KRMU).
    

    The entire history of Rocky Mountain PBS is being archived by an award-winning
    volunteer-driven project known as [“Station’s Archived Memories”](http://www.rmpbs.org/volunteer/sam/)
    (SAM).  The archive project was founded in 2000. To date, the dedicated group
    of volunteers has meticulously collected and digitally archived over 50,000 photographs,
    195 Oral History interviews, 15,000 Station documents, 3,500 Memorabilia pieces
    as well as inventoried 11,500 KRMA/Rocky Mountain PBS productions and digitally
    preserved 700 local programs.  To learn more about the archives at Rocky Mountain

    Frying Pans West - (1968) Hosted by Mr. Sam Arnold and produced
    by Mr. Richard “Dick” Siceloff, the 1968 program is a compilation of recipes,
    anecdotes and little known facts about the early West and our American gastronomic
    heritage.

    Glenarm Place - (1983) Glenarm Place showcased a variety of local musical
    talent. It premiered May 7 1983, 10:30 PM. Produced by Kaye Lavine, hosted by
    Hank Troy and directed  by David Ryan.   DVD copies of “Glenarm Place” in the
    SAM archives.  Performances were simulcast in stereo with KCFR Radio (90.1 FM)

    The
    Naturalists - (1973) KRMA’s most ambitious projects yet was undertaken beginning
    March 11, 1973.  Titled “The naturalists,” it is a program about four of America’s
    greatest naturalists:  John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs and Theodore
    Roosevelt.  Jim Case,   KRMA’s “Special Projects Cine Unit,” under the direction
    of Jim Case produced the four-hour program series. Case believed the understanding
    of the work of these four men will be a valuable addition to the life of the nation.
    The four half-hour programs were produced by KRMA-TV under the supervision of
    the special projects director, James Case.  The objective of the series, is “to
    help contemporary society to re-learn the values and laws of nature these men
    came to slowly and naturally.” To assure accuracy, each shooting script was authenticated
    by a “content authority:--a man or woman who personally knew the naturalist or
    is an authority on his life and work.

    Stateline - (1983) Stateline was a program
    dedicated to coverage of the Colorado State legislature.

    Rocky Mountain Legacy
    - (premiered in July, 1994) Rocky Mountain Legacy sought out the stories of those
    who bravely faced the risks associated with any worthwhile endeavor.  Colorado
    was  poppulated  in the earliest days, by seekers: people seeking wealth, health
    or the wide open spaces of the west.  The gold rush days and the tuberculosis
    epidemic of the 1800s, the growth of the railroad industry in the mountain region
    and the Great Depression - these were just some of the reasons people were drawn
    to the Rocky Mountains.  Through journal entries, diaries and interviews,  the
    hardship and sacrifice as well as the triumph and satisfaction that built both
    urban and rural communities across Colorado are depicted in Rocky Mountain Legacy.

    When KQED went on the air in 1954, it was one of a handful of stations
    in a new field referred to as the “educational TV movement.” Conceived initially
    as a teaching tool, the station quickly broadened its scope to include entertainment
    and public affairs programming. The young station made a name for itself by airing
    the famous 1958 Teller-Pauling debate on nuclear fallout as well as controversial
    inquiries into homosexuality, racial prejudice and communism. 

    KQED originated
    the idea of selling memberships, staging an annual auction and developing other
    fundraising methods that became widespread throughout the public television system.
    

    During the 1968 San Francisco newspaper strike, KQED founded Newspaper of the
    Air, public television’s first daily news program. Ten years later, KQED, for
    the first time, broadcasts a full- seven-day schedule with addition of Saturday
    afternoon programming.

    KQED Public Radio became the first station — commercial
    or noncommercial — to try an all-news format on FM. On August 12, 1987, the station
    changed format from a classical music station that also aired Morning Edition
    and All Things Considered to an all news and information station. Two years later,
    KQED Public Radio becomes an around-the-clock, in-depth news and public affairs
    broadcasting station on July 1. In 1993, it is the most-listened-to public radio
    station in the country.

    In January 1995, KQED publicly launched its website featuring
    program listings, press releases and content from San Francisco Focus magazine.
    And five years later, KQED-TV enters the digital age by broadcasting a high definition
    signal and soon launched five new digital channels: KQED HD, KQED Encore, KQED
    World, KQED Life and KQED Kids.

    In 2011, KQED Public Radio becomes not only the
    most-listened-to public radio station in the nation, but the most-listened-to
    radio station in the Bay Area. KQED Public Television defies the national curve
    by increasing viewership, which often places it as the most-watched public television
    station in America. Usage of KQED's online and mobile services has more than tripled
    in the past 18 months -- and that was before the launch of the KQED iPhone app.
    With the development of public media's first radio Pledge Free Stream and the
    use of social media with thousands of friends and subscribers on Facebook, Twitter
    and Interactive blogs, KQED's reach continues to expand. That April, KQED rolls
    out an alternative to the classic pledge drive that April. The Pledge-Free Stream
    was the first time any public radio station offered members the option of listening
    on their computers or smartphones without pledge-break interruptions. 

    In December
    2012, KQED entered into an innovative partnership with the Knight Foundation to
    create Matter Ventures, a startup accelerator and early-stage venture capital
    fund that supports and invests in media entrepreneurs working to create a more
    informed, connected and empowered society.

    By 2014, KQED Public Television stations
    are often the nation’s most watched public television stations in prime time,
    and KQED Public Radio is the most-listened-to public radio station in the nation.
    Additionally, KQED’s social media has more than 1 million fans across all channels.

    WJCT went on the air on September 10, 1958, broadcasting a report
    on educational television from Florida Governor Leroy Collins. Its broadcast reached
    Live Oak, St. Augustine, Palatka, and Folkston, Georgia. WJCT became Florida’s
    second educational television station, following Miami, and preceding Gainesville’s
    WUFT and Tampa’s WEDU by several weeks. WJCT filled its first month with “national
    educational television” programs from PBS’ predecessor, NET.

    On April 10, 1972,
    WJCT added its second media platform, meeting the community’s needs for fine arts
    and music. WJCT-FM went on the air as “Stereo 90,” broadcasting music, news and
    public affairs programming approximately 18 hours a day. Eighteen months later,
    in October 1973, Channel 7 and Stereo 90 presented their first simulcast, broadcasting
    a concert by the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra.

    In May of 2014, the launch
    of the Digital Convergence Alliance Network Operations Center (DCA-NOC) marked
    the culmination of work begun four years prior by WJCT Public Broadcasting. WJCT
    spearheaded a major initiative, laying the foundation for a collaborative venture
    of 11 public television stations that would not only foster economies of scale
    but create opportunities to better serve their respective communities, the first
    of which is the DCA-NOC. A grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
    (CPB) enabled WJCT and community partners to develop a technical plan for the
    creation of a centralized master control operation.

    Throughout its 56-year history,
    the First Coast community has been a vital component of WJCT’s success, providing
    individual and corporate support, contributing countless hours of volunteer work,
    serving on boards, partnering in productions, events and services. With continuing
    community support, WJCT stands poised to serve the First Coast community for another
    50 years, and more, using its unique assets as a resource for citizens to come
    together to celebrate human diversity, experience lifelong learning, and actively
    engage in matters of civic importance, all to improve the quality of our lives

    Unalaska Community Broadcasting is a non-profit organization that
    has served Unalaska since 1984. We began as a local access television station
    and have since developed into a provider of television, radio, a website, and
    various social media outlets.  We were incorporated in 1984 as a 501(c)3 charitable
    organization known at the time as Unalaska Community Television. UCTV broadcast
    a low-power television signal to the community of Unalaska over channel 8.  Channel
    8 Television has been on the air continuously since then. 

    Our broadcast service
    area is the community of Unalaska and the Port of Dutch Harbor, the hub of the
    Aleutian Islands. Since UCB opened its doors in the 1980s, Unalaska has grown
    to become the 11th largest community in the state, and Dutch Harbor is one of
    the top fishing ports in the nation.  Residents turn to our organization for news
    and information from a trusted local source.  We are the only media organization
    based in our region, and these days our reach goes far beyond our island.   We

    Licensed to The Ohio State University, WOSU Public Media has been
    a vital community resource since 1920, when it received one of the first experimental
    radio licenses in the country. It has evolved into multiple public media services
    consisting of Classical 101 (FM); 89.7 NPR News (FM); four regional FM stations;
    and WOSU TV (PBS) and its sister station, WPBO TV. WOSU television covers a quarter
    of central and southern Ohio reaching over 900,000 households.

    Current major
    projects are led by the Columbus Neighborhoods project, developed in 2010 to focus
    on the history, culture and future of the community’s distinctive neighborhoods.
    The Emmy and NETA Award winning initiative includes a series of major documentaries
    (12 over a five year period), radio programming, public engagement events including
    local storytelling and premieres.

    Other television initiatives include the arts
    and culture weekly series Broad & High developed in 2013 as part of a local/national
    collaboration; the weekly public affairs program Columbus On The Record; the daily
    broadcast on the WOSU Ohio Channel of our local NPR radio program All Sides with
    Ann Fisher; and a series of national documentaries focused on explorers with ties
    to Ohio.  These have included John Glenn: A Life of Service and the upcoming documentary
    on Admiral Richard Byrd’s exploits.

    In 2006, WOSU opened new television studios
    at the COSI Science Center in downtown Columbus. All local program production
    is developed at the WOSU@COSI Studios, which also serves as our prime community
    engagement space.

    KUED first signed on the air on January 20, 1958, with an episode
    of The Friendly Giant. Original broadcasts from improvised studios were set up
    in the basement of the old student union building on the University of Utah campus.
    The station had humble beginnings, with the use of primitive equipment, and a
    donated transmitter (thanks to a donation from Time-Life Inc., then-owners of
    KTVT Channel 4) and a $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation, KUED began broadcasting
    educational programming for the public in Utah.

    Early programming was purely
    educational, in some cases consisting of nothing more than a teacher standing
    in front of a chalk board and lecturing. About half of the programs aired were
    locally-produced, with the rest coming from National Educational Television (NET)
    and other sources. When the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded NET in
    1970, the focus of programming changed to educational and entertainment programming.

    In
    1993 KUED moved to it's current location, the Dolores Dore Eccles Broadcast Center.
    Moving to this new facility allowed KUED to grow and produce additional programming
    that previously had not been possible. These programs are vital educational and
    informational resources that are not available from any other station in our state,
    many of which have aired nationally over PBS. In addition to documentaries like,
    Secrets  of the Lost Canyon, Utah's World War II Stories, Maynard Dixon: To the
    Desert Again and Wild River, KUED produces Utah Now, Utah Conversations with Ted
    Capener, The Governor's News Conference, Vote Utah, and a number of special features
    for the University of Utah. We also produce the yearly Christmas with the Mormon
    Tabernacle Choir concert that has become a favorite of Utah's viewers, as well
    as PBS viewers across the country.

    With a commitment to lifelong learning, culture,
    education, children and helping the under-served, KUED has offered the finest
    television available. It is our vision that KUED will be the "Public Square"
    for our viewers - where learning is revered, diversity is welcomed, intelligence
    is respected, free expression is safeguarded, curiosity is prized, fairness is
    expected, citizens are engaged, and children are cherished and nurtured.

  history_md: |
    In 1965, a group of concerned citizens and educators established
    the Blue Ridge Educational Television (ETV) Association, with the goal of bringing
    educational television to Southwest Virginia. With seed money from the City of
    Roanoke and funding from nineteen area school systems, ETV then applied for state
    and federal grants to build the facilities. Groundbreaking for the studio building
    took place November 1966.

    On August 1, 1967, Southwest Virginia’s own public
    television station went on the air for the very first time as Blue Ridge Educational
    Television, WBRA-TV, channel 15—broadcasting from its new production facility
    in Roanoke. It was the nation's first all-color educational television station.
    WBRA’s all-color capabilities brought national attention in 1968 when RCA’s “Broadcast
    News Magazine” did an extensive layout about the station. Initially there were
    no broadcasts on weekends, and the station signed off every weekday at 11 p.m.
    Within those broadcast hours, WBRA staff were offering an alternative to commercial
    television.   In addition to broadcasts for schools, WBRA began the tradition
    of providing quality entertainment programming.

    Color programming was especially
    popular with educators who were using WBRA broadcasts in classrooms. During the
    school year, the station aired nearly seven hours of instructional programming
    every weekday. At that time, the station employed six studio teachers who led
    the daily televised lessons, which covered subjects such as science, music, geography,
    and economics. In 1969, instruction and entertainment were expertly combined when
    “Sesame Street” and “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” were added to WBRA’s schedule.

    For the first few years, WBRA’s reach was limited to portions of 15 counties
    surrounding the City of Roanoke. With the addition of two more transmitters, Blue
    Ridge PBS expanded its coverage area to the farthest corners of Southwest Virginia
    and into bordering counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and North Carolina—a
    total of 26,000 square-miles. WSBN in Norton went on the air in 1971, and WMSY
    in Marion completed the trio of Blue Ridge PBS’ stations when it went on the air
    in 1981.

    Today people travel the world with Blue Ridge PBS, visiting distant
    destinations as well as special places and people across the Blue Ridge region.
    Blue Ridge PBS, still community owned, has grown into a 21st century, multimedia
    organization. It is now the region’s story teller, serving 2.5 million individuals
    as an around-the-clock source for thoughtful news and documentaries, arts and
    culture programming, and the best in children’s television.

    In recent years,
    investments in digital technologies have enabled Blue Ridge PBS to triple the
    amount of programming available to regional viewers. Viewers can now choose from
    three digital channels: Blue Ridge PBS, Southwest Virginia Public TV and World.
  productions_md: |
    Blue Ridge Nightline was a public affairs show that was on the
    air for over 20 years covering a wide variety of topics.  The show had a number
    of title variations over the years as hosts changed.  Several episodes of Hake
    Wheeler’s Nightline were part of the collection we digitized for the archives
    project.   

    Blue Ridge PBS worked with nationally known historian, James I. Robertson,
    Jr. to produce a 10 part series on the Civil War.

    In addition, the station produced
    a 3 hour documentary on Virginia in the Civil War to commemorate the 150th anniversary
    of the war.  This program was broken down into modules and designed specifically
    for use in the schools.  A set of the DVDs went to each school in Virginia.

  history_md: |
    In 1969, just two years after the proposal was first made for a fine
    arts radio station in Youngstown, Ohio, with the hard work of Don Elser, first
    director Steve Grcevich, and Youngstown State University president Albert Pugsley,
    WYSU-FM signed on the air at 88.5 MHZ, licensed to Youngstown State University.
    The date was October 23, and the time was 10:00 am, with program host Bill Foster
    introducing Richard Strauss’ Also sprach Zarathustra.  The station began by broadcasting
    12 hours daily from its studios in the former Valley Park Motel on Wick Avenue,
    and served Youngstown State University and the Mahoning Valley community.  WYSU-FM
    is a charter member of National Public Radio. Some of the first programs to air
    were NPR’s All Things Considered, WYSU’s Folk Festival with Charles Darling, and
    the syndicated program Adventures in Good Music with Karl Haas.  

    With a small
    staff, WYSU made great strides over the next decades, becoming part of the first
    radio network using satellite-delivered programs in 1971, moving to new studios
    in 1976, and expanding to a 24-hour broadcast day in 1980.  Also in 1980, WYSU
    held its first on-air pledge drive, a practice that continues twice yearly, and
    remains a major source of funding for the station.  

    Under the guidance of director
    Robert Peterson in the 1980s and 1990s, the station began airing Morning Edition
    and operating a new 50,000 watt transmitter.  The addition of translators in nearby
    Ashtabula, Ohio and New Wilmington, Pennsylvania expanded WYSU’s coverage.  In
    1996, state of the art digital editing equipment was installed, and overnight
    programs became automated.

    In the late 1990s, WYSU collaborated with the McDonough
    Museum of Contemporary Art at YSU in launching the first Mad About the Arts event
    – a celebration of great art, food, music and dance.  The event is now in its
    20th successful year of raising funds to support both organizations.  In 2000,
    classical music host Barbara Krauss planned the first station-sponsored European
    tour to Great Britain.  The tours have since taken groups of WYSU travelers all
    over the world. 

    Gary Sexton, WYSU’s current director of broadcasting, took the
    position in 2000.  Under his direction, a WYSU website (wysu.org) was established,
    as well as streaming audio. By 2004, digital equipment was installed in the broadcast
    studios.  WYSU began broadcasting in HD in 2007, adding an all classical HD channel
    a year later.  In tandem with these advances, the station continues to produce
    music and community affairs programs with local hosts and guests.  Fund drives
    have continued to be successful and the staff and supporting members remain committed
    to WYSU’s mission as a public radio station:  to be the community’s leading source
    for trusted, in-depth news, engaging conversation, and music that stimulates the
    mind and spirit.

  history_md: |
    What began with a hand-me-down trailer house headquarters and television
    transmitter tower on the edge of Fargo, North Dakota, is now a television and
    radio network that serves North Dakota, portions of its border states, and several
    communities in Manitoba, Canada. In service to households in the region for 50
    years, Prairie Public is not showing signs of being over-the-hill. Rather, it
    continues to embrace technological advances in the medium while remaining remarkably
    close to the same mission it has had from the beginning—to deliver programs that
    educate, involve, and inspire, without commercial interruption. 

    The organization
    was conceived in August of 1959 when a forward-thinking Dr. Ted Donat presided
    over the incorporation of the North Central Educational Television Association.
    In July of 1963, after nearly four years of planning and development, the first
    employee was hired, and North Central Educational Television was about to go live.
    The Association’s first station, KFME-TV (Channel 13, Fargo), aired its first
    broadcast in January of 1964.

    That first public television signal was an abbreviated
    three-hour schedule. Prairie Public’s first local production, an English Literature
    course for Moorhead Minnesota’s Concordia College, began in 1965. KFME began broadcasting
    in color in 1967, the same year President Johnson signed The Public Broadcasting
    Act. 

    North Central Educational Television had a growth spurt in the ‘70s, changed
    its name to Prairie Public Television, and expanded its broadcast area to include
    the entire state of North Dakota. In the ‘80s, radio broadcasts were added, and
    the brand has since changed to Prairie Public.

    Prairie Public is proud of its
    award-winning television documentaries, including an award-winning series about
    the history and culture of the Germans from Russia, a series of documentaries
    in collaboration with the Plains CO2 Reduction Partnership led by the University
    of North Dakota’s Energy & Environmental Research Center, the nationally broadcast
    “Painting with Paulson” art instruction series, and documentaries about Homesteading,
    Prairie Churches, the Old Red Trail, Scandinavian Traditions, regional artists
    and musicians, and many more.

    Prairie Public has embraced new technology, adding
    web content, social media communications and online viewing and listening. The
    switch from analogue to digital broadcasting—Prairie Public was the first in the
    region to do so—allowed for more great programming for schools, more hours of
    non-violent children’s programming for families, and the stunning clarity of high-definition
    television. Just as the public adjusted from black and white color back in the
    ‘60’s, large high-definition televisions have become the norm in most households
    as Prairie Public turns 50.

    Telling Our Legacies Digitally
    (TOLD) - WGBY’s TOLD is a community-based digital storytelling project that is
    designed to engage members of our communities.  In this series of interactive
    workshops, participants learn through a fun, hands-on, team-building approach
    and are guided through a process that combines storytelling with modern-day technology.
    Participants write their own scripts, create storyboards, and record their voices.
    Each participant also learns how to edit photographs, add effects, and use video
    software to assemble all of these elements into a “digital story.” At the end
    of the workshop, WGBY invites peers, family, and community to a public screening
    of the stories where participants talk about their experience in the workshop.
    The screenings are remarkable, healing, and transformational. The stories give
    voice to the voiceless, strengthen literacy, stimulate dialogue, and build community.
    These digital stories preserve the history, culture, ideas, and legacies of our
    community.

    WQED was the nation’s first community-supported television station
    and went on the air on April 1, 1954.  In 1973, Classical WQED-FM 89.3 was founded
    as the region’s only 24-hour classical radio station.

    Today, WQED is educational
    public media with four television programming streams: WQED-TV; WQED: The Neighborhood
    Channel; WQED: The Create Channel; and WQED Showcase; three radio streams: WQED-FM
    89.3; WQEJ-FM 89.7/Johnstown; The Pittsburgh Concert Channel at WQED-FM HD-2 and

    listening area, and online around the world;  local and national television and
    radio productions; WQED Interactive, and iQ: smartmedia, WQED’s Educational initiative.
    
    Throughout its history, WQED has partnered with hundreds of local community
    organizations toward improvements in education; arts and culture; community health;
    economics; and important local issues through its form of civic journalism.  As
    the only community-owned multimedia resource in the region, WQED is a convener,
    a central gathering place, and a conduit for other local non-profit organizations.
    
    WQED has exported the region nationally with projects like The War That Made
    America, a four part historical documentary on the French and Indian War that
    aired nationwide on PBS; national cooking shows with Chris Fennimore; the Doo
    Wop music franchise; weekly national radio broadcasts of the Pittsburgh Symphony
    Orchestra and a continuing series of local and national documentaries by Emmy
    Award-winning producer Rick Sebak. 

    WQED’s latest national production, August
    Wilson: The Ground On Which I Stand, is slated to air nationally on PBS American
    Masters in February 2015.  The documentary will focus on the life and work of
    Pittsburgh-native and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson and will
    include and extensive educational initiative in key cities across the country.
    

    WQED is one of the busiest producers of local programming in the PBS system.
    In addition to the local and national documentaries, WQED produces and airs
    local programs that capture the stories of advancement, arts and diversity in
    our region. 

    Classical WQED-FM is “the voice of the arts in western Pennsylvania”
    by highlighting all that the station has meant for the region with retrospectives,
    tributes, community events, and celebrations. WQED-FM has offered classical and
    fine arts and cultural programs since its inception in 1973, allowing listeners

    accessible to viewers and listeners, any time, and any place. WQED reaches more
    than 37,000 people through social media. 

    iQ: smartmedia is our strategy for
    education to capitalize on what kids have inside of them and to capture that potential.
    Around it revolves all of WQED's educational goals and objectives: to provide
    new tools and models, thought leadership, research, and training on the intersection
    of media and learning to prepare our children for a competitive world. We provide
    content for science and technology; literacy; global cultures and connections;
    expression; social and community responsibility; numeracy; and behavioral wellness.

    Today, UNC-TV is the 12-station statewide public television network
    for North Carolina, reaching all 100 counties with four channels of national and
    local program content, as well as parts of Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee
    and Georgia.  A lot has changed since WUNC-TV in Chapel Hill signed on as the
    nation’s tenth “educational television” station on January 8, 1955, largely due
    to the efforts of three visionary leaders.  William C. “Billy” Carmichael, the
    University of North Carolina’s vice president for finance, University alumnus
    and famous band lead Kay Kyser, and eventual university president William Friday
    – then the assistant to the university’s president, Gordon Gray – spearheaded
    an effort to use the burgeoning power of television to bring non-commercial educational
    content to the citizens of the state.  This group recognized the unique opportunity
    when the Federal Communications Commission offered eight channels in North Carolina
    for non-commercial uses in 1952.  They traveled the state marshaling contributions
    and support for both public and private funding, and so UNC-TV was born.

    William
    Friday became president of the university system in 1957, and during his legendary
    30 year tenure in that position, he continued to be a powerful and effective advocate
    for the importance and value of public television.  Gradually, it transitioned
    from an operation run primarily by students and faculty members to a fully professional
    broadcasting organization.  With the advent of PBS in 1968, UNC-TV was transformed
    from the old educational television model to being a source for mission-driven
    programming for general audiences.  In the meantime, UNC-TV continued to expand
    its reach, gradually adding transmitter sites to cover more of the state.  In
    1979, the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television was established
    by the university’s board of governors, and 10 years later operations were finally
    consolidated in one location, the network’s current headquarters and studios in
    Research Triangle Park.

    In many ways, the much-beloved William Friday was the
    face of UNC-TV.  In addition to his advocacy and leadership as university president,
    he was also the host of the longest-running program in UNC-TV history, North Carolina
    People with William Friday.  The program went on the air in 1971 and continued
    its weekly run until President Friday passed away at the age of 92 in October,
    2012.  In a warm and informal one-on-one interview format, Friday engaged North
    Carolinians from all walks of life, from the exalted to the humble, coaxing out
    the stories that make every life interesting, and his viewing audience remained
    loyal throughout his life. In 2014 the Board of Governors of the National Academy
    of Television Arts and Sciences, Nashville/Midsouth Chapter, honored William Friday
    with posthumous induction as the inaugural member of its Gold Circle for his exceptional
    service to the advancement of public television.  At the same time, the chapter
    also presented UNC-TV with its Governor’s Award in recognition of the network’s
    history of exemplary service to the state of North Carolina.

    Today, UNC-TV not
    only brings programming from PBS, the BBC and other sources to the entire state,
    it produces more than 300 hours of original programming each year for and about
    North Carolina.  Looking to the future, UNC-TV continues extending its content
    into the ever-growing array of digital platforms, and expanding its mission to
    include even more opportunities for public service.

    of Northern Iowa.  This statewide public radio network (a total of 24 stations) 
    now serves 236,000 listeners with three programming streams:  News, News/Studio 
    One and Classical.  IPR’s combined radio groups serve rural and urban Iowa, 
    touching all of Iowa’s 99 counties. 

    Our history is long and proud:  Iowa State University and University of Iowa 
    each have public radio stations that are nearly a century old, with FCC 
    licenses that were among the first 100 radio licenses ever granted, and 
    our statewide network is one that other states look to as a model.  This 
    century of service to and for Iowans is the foundation for our future."

  history_md: 'WXXI Public Broadcasting Council was founded in 1958 as the Rochester
    Area Educational Television Association (RAETA), and the station''s first few
    years were dedicated to producing instructional television programs for elementary
    school students. In 1959, Assignment: The World became the first educational series
    WXXI produced. More than fifty years later, the program went on to be the longest-running
    instructional TV program in the U.S., and was offered nationwide until it ceased
    production in 2013. On September 6, 1966, after a five-year quest for a broadcast
    license, Channel 21 went on the air, broadcasting 50 hours of programming a week.
    The following year, Congress established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
    (CPB) to promote growth of the industry, which resulted in a consistent funding
    base for the station. In 1974 WXXI signed on with its all-classical radio station
    Classical 91.5, and in 1984 it signed on its NPR station on AM 1370. Today, the
    station owns and operates three television channels (WXXI-TV/HD, Create, and World)
    and operates cable City 12 in partnership with the City of Rochester. Its radio
    stations now include: WXXI-AM 1370, WXXI-FM 91.5, plus two HD radio channels and
    Reachout Radio, a closed circuit 24-hour radio reading service for those who are
    visually impaired.  WXXI also manages and operates WRUR-FM 88.5 in broadcast partnership
    with the University of Rochester, along with two radio stations in partnership
    with Hobart & William Smith Colleges – WEOS-FM 89.7 in Geneva, NY and WITH-FM
    90.1 in Ithaca, NY. WXXI also provides educational and outreach services, and
    a robust web site, which serves the greater Rochester community with music, science,
    health, and news programs that inspire, engage, educate, and inform.  In January
    2012, WXXI and Rochester’s Independent Film House, Little Theatre, joined together
    in a formal, long-term affiliation.'

    KNME-TV signed on the air in 1958 as the first public “educational”
    television station in New Mexico.  Licensed to both the University of New Mexico
    and Albuquerque Public Schools, KNME-TV is unique in broadcasting with this diverse,
    collaborative licensee structure. New Mexico PBS serves the people of New Mexico
    by providing engaging local and national content, in-depth news and public affairs,
    digital media, education and outreach services, lifelong learning, an interactive
    web site, and a celebration of arts and culture.

    As the television industry has
    matured and changed so has KNME-TV.  Our history of accomplishments includes a
    number of groundbreaking television shows like Dr. George Fishbeck’s Science,
    Colores!, and New Mexico in Focus.  KNME was the first television station in New
    Mexico to broadcast a digital signal and to adopt the new digital high-definition
    standard on a continuous basis.   KNME-TV is one of the most watched public television
    stations in the country reaching almost 700,000 households each week with 20,000
    members in central and northern New Mexico.

    In 2009, KNMD-TV joined KNME-TV as
    a second Public Television service, providing enlightening and entertaining programming
    in support of New Mexico’s education systems.  This increase in capacity, concurrent
    with innovations in on-line delivery of content, and expansion of our satellite
    distribution services drove the need for a new umbrella brand, New Mexico PBS.

    New Mexico PBS operates two digital high power transmitters and 33 low-power
    translators to provide free over the air viewing to the people of New Mexico.
    These transmitters provided greater than 99% reliability during the past year.
    New Mexico PBS recently added a new translator to the Shiprock area which serves
    the Navajo Nation.

    New Mexico PBS has extensive partnerships throughout the community.
    These partnerships include the K-12 community, higher-education, dozens of community
    service organizations and more.  Our broad reach on-air, on-line and on the ground
    comprise an extensive educational and community service organization in New Mexico.
    New Mexico PBS’ Ready to Learn Service impacts the lives of thousands of children
    in New Mexico presenting over 90 workshops for parents and caregivers and distributing
    thousands of books.

    New Mexico PBS provides important local programming to the
    citizens of New Mexico. New Mexico PBS productions have won national and regional
    awards including a Peabody Award, a national Emmy, and 40 regional Emmys.

    Ozarks Public Television is the Missouri State licensee for KOZK-TV,
    channel 21 in Springfield, Missouri and KOZJ-TV, channel 26 in Joplin, Missouri.

    As
    a university licensee, KOZK's studios and offices are located on the Missouri
    State University campus in Springfield.

    Ozarks Public Television provides PBS
    programming and instructional television services to 549,540 households in Southwest
    Missouri and the adjoining three state area. OPTV broadcasts 168 hours of programming
    per week with a supporting membership of about 6,500 members and over 100 corporate
    and institutional underwriters.

    Strong local community commitment, support, and
    involvement provides a volunteer staff augmenting station operations in a variety
    of tasks. Volunteers provide support in production, administrative, and fundraising
    tasks, including operation of two televised auctions.

    KOZJ/channel 26, a "satellite"
    station of KOZK/Springfield, began broadcasting in 1986. Although a Missouri State
    licensee, the business office is located in downtown Joplin with transmission
    facilities located at KODE, the Joplin ABC affiliate.

    Ozarks Public Television
    offices and studios are located in Strong Hall on the Missouri State University
    campus in Springfield, Missouri.

    We strive to ensure we capture the history and
    heritage that has made the Ozarks a great place to live.  Just like everyone else
    we are a small staff trying to do a lot of work that informs, educates and entertains
    our viewers.
  productions_md: |
    OzarksWatch Video Magazine – The goal of the series is to increase
    a knowledge and understanding of the region.  The series began in 1999, and we
    do approximately 12 to 15 new shows a year.  It airs weekly and documents, presents
    and preserves the unique heritage of the Ozarks.  We have over 210 episodes completed
    over the years and they can be seen by going to our website.

    Local Documentaries
    – We produced our first local documentary in 2003 entitled, Ozark Jubilee:  A
    Living Legacy.  After that we started doing one new one a year and now we are
    producing two local documentaries each year.  They have a wide range of topics
    and have been a huge success for our station.  Again, a list of these productions
    are on our website as well.  The last two we did this year was Stately Images:
    The Public Art of Missouri’s State Capitol (it was a 30 minute program based on
    all the art work that is in our state capitol building in Jefferson City, including
    many painting by Thomas Hart Benton) and the second program was Links to the Past,
    Fairways to the Future (it was a 90 minute documentary that centered around the
    history of golf in the Ozarks which dates back over 100 years and went all the
    present).  We are currently sitting on 17 documentaries (ranging from 30 to
    120 minutes in length with two more for 2015 in production now).

    Passport to
    China – This is a series of 12 programs that we produced to help people become
    better acquainted with the people, customs, traditions and language of China.
    MSU currently has over 800 students enrolled from China and in return we send
    students and faculty members to China.  The programs provide insight to the culture
    of Chinese people, take people in the Ozarks to places they may have only read
    about and show them how much we are alike.  It has been a very successful series
    and we are currently preparing to do a new series of shows about South America,
    Central America, Mexico and Cuba.  That series will begin in January of 2016.

    Known for quality programming throughout Central Indiana, WFYI Public
    Media provides more than just the standard radio and television services. WFYI
    has been involved as a community leader and partner in education, health, public
    affairs, and the arts since 1970. We serve as a public forum where people are
    encouraged to discuss and debate issues important to the local community. Our
    award-winning documentaries and public affairs programs have addressed many relevant
    topics ‒ including financial literacy, healthcare, workforce development and environmental
    affairs. This broadcast schedule combines with local community outreach programs
    to focus on developing successful solutions to local issues.

    Forty-three years
    ago WFYI Public Media was formed after many local residents in Central Indiana
    voiced the need to create the state’s first educational television system. A local
    community leader, Ardath Y. Burkhart, passionately led a small grass-roots campaign
    to create a local educational television station. This group became affectionately
    known as "Ardath's Army" and quickly gained community support by traveling door-to-door
    across Indianapolis and its six surrounding counties. The volunteers pushed the
    station into existence in just a few short weeks by raising enough money to cover
    a full year of operating expenses. The station first signed on the air with a
    no-frills staff of nine employees, three black-and-white television cameras, and
    a signal that reached just beyond downtown Indianapolis. WFYI was the city's first
    UHF television signal and the only channel to provide commercial-free programming
    ‒ a novel idea, even 40 years ago.

    Now, more than 80 professionals work hard
    at WFYI Public Media to make it Indiana’s chief PBS and NPR member station and
    one of Central Indiana’s leading not-for-profits. The WFYI headquarters is a state-of-the-art
    facility conveniently situated at 1630 N. Meridian St. in Indianapolis. The WFYI
    location is one of Indianapolis' premier media hubs and centers for civic engagement.

    As
    WFYI Public Media looks towards the future, it will continue to focus on expanding
    its local production capacity; enhancing its community services to both mainstream
    and underserved audiences; and building on its proven track record of delivering
    first-rate local, national and international news coverage.

    WDVX:  Grassroots Radio

    WDVX Radio came into existence because a
    like-minded bunch of people around East Tennessee wanted a radio station that
    represented the culture of the region and celebrated the music that emerged from
    generations of people swapping tunes and playing on the porch, and its modern
    evolution.  Cumberland Communities Communications Corporation was incorporated
    in 1991, the first step in creating the radio station.  

    Radio Station in a Camper
    

    As happens with grassroots efforts, it was November 1997 when WDVX actually
    went on the air.  The efforts of a number of passionate people brought a new sound
    to East Tennessee and the world.  At its foundation were Campbell County native
    and DJ Tony Lawson (now WDVX Program Director), broadcast engineer Don Burggraf,
    and a small board of directors that included Appalachian land trust innovator
    Marie Cirillo. A small, donated camping trailer parked in a campground off I-275
    became the station’s first permanent home.  

    The station plays a wide range of
    music:  Bluegrass, Blues, Gospel, Old Time, Celtic, Alt-Country, early Jazz, classic
    Country, Cajun, American roots, and on and on. 

    In 2004, WDVX moved into new
    studios inside the new Knoxville Visitor Center in downtown Knoxville, and a brand
    new tradition was born.   The Blue Plate Special, which had been a short set of
    recorded music in the camper with occasional live performances, developed into
    a daily live lunch-time concert before a studio audience.  Nowadays the show is
    6 days a week, always at noon, and features two acts – local or touring musicians
    who provide top entertainment to music fans from around the globe. 

    Live performance
    is a big part of WDVX programming.  The station also produces a monthly show for
    kids and kids at heart called “Kidstuff,” “First Friday Live,” to coincide with
    the city’s monthly arts celebration and “Tennessee Shines,” a weekly radio music
    and spoken word program that originates from a local musical pub.  

    WDVX produces
    at least three free live concerts in the downtown Knoxville’s Market Square each
    year, and a festival at Ijams Nature Center, a 244-acre park minutes from downtown
    Knoxville.  

    The station airs Tennessee Farm Table, a weekly, locally produced
    program that features area farmers, seed savers, chefs, and food enthusiasts.

    WDVX partners with community organizations throughout the area to promote
    the arts and culture of the region.  We invite you to tune in at 89.9 FM, 102.9
    in downtown Knoxville, 93.9 in Seymour/Seven Islands area, wdvx.com, or attend
    a live performance and become part of East Tennessee’s Own.

    Koahnic Broadcast Corporation was created as a non-profit media corporation
    in 1992 by Alaska Native leaders to preserve culture and languages, combat widespread
    misconceptions and prejudices against Alaska Natives, and create cross-cultural
    bridges. Since our creation, Koahnic Broadcast Corporation has been a national
    leader in Native American radio broadcasting, media production, and training.
    

    Koahnic operates KNBA 90.3 FM in Anchorage, Alaska, the first urban Native radio
    station, which signed on in October 1996. KNBA broadcasts news, public affairs
    and contemporary music to Anchorage and surrounding areas, and streams its signal
    online. KNBA also produces special programming, such as annual broadcast coverage
    of the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention that is carried by stations across
    the state.

    Koahnic is the nation’s primary producer and distributor of Native
    public radio programming. Koahnic’s award-winning national radio programs include:
    Native America Calling, a weekday one-hour live moderated call-in program; National
    Native News, a weekday 5-minute news feature that has been recognized repeatedly
    by the Native American Journalists Association; and Earthsongs, a dynamic weekly
    feature spotlighting contemporary Native music. 

    Starting in 2006, Koahnic has
    operated Native Voice One (NV1), the national Native radio program distribution
    service. Through NV1 distribution, Native radio programs reach the majority of
    the Alaska Native population and the American Indian reservation audience through
    carriage by most of the country’s 55 Native-owned stations. NV1 programs are also
    heard on public radio stations serving urban areas including Atlanta, Orlando,
    Phoenix, and Sacramento, as well as smaller cities like Duluth, Minnesota; Bloomington,
    Indiana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Asheville, North Carolina. 

    NV1 station affiliation
    includes 400 public radio stations and repeaters, including 50 Native stations
    in rural communities. Many more listeners access the NV1 and KNBA webstreams on
    mobile devices to hear these shows that are engaging Native America.

    National Native News (NNN) - a daily five-minute newscast, has
    been the leading daily news service focused on Native issues for 27 years. NNN
    is the only news program of this kind produced and anchored entirely by a Native
    staff.  Broadcast Monday through Friday on more than 300 U.S. and Canadian radio
    stations and their translators, NNN is anchored and produced by Antonia Gonzales
    (Navajo), with reporters contributing stories from across the country.

    Native
    America Calling (NAC) - broadcast live nationwide, is an intense and stimulating
    one-hour call-in radio talk show. NAC is produced by Koahnic five days a week
    and broadcast via NV1 to stations across the country. There is no other national
    forum in any medium for this kind of exchange on Native issues. Native and non-Native
    leaders in government, business and the arts recognize this and take advantage
    of the opportunity to participate in NAC’s talking circle. Both members of rural
    and reservation Native communities and Native people listening from urban areas
    may call in and speak directly to people closest to Native issues. Since 1995
    NAC has provided links between Native and non-Native people, enabling callers
    to speak out on a variety of subjects that educate and enlighten their communities
    and other public radio audiences. Hosted by Tara Gatewood (Isleta), the program
    is broadcast on nearly 100 Native and public radio stations and translators.

    Earthsongs
    - a weekly public radio program produced in Alaska and distributed nationally
    via NV1. Since 1999, Earthsongs has been the primary showcase for contemporary
    Native American and Indigenous music and culture. Hosted and produced by Alexis
    Sallee (Iñupiaq and Mexican-American), the hour-long program is carried by nearly
    100 public radio stations across 16 states, and streamed online. Each hour of
    Earthsongs features exclusive artist interviews, and a carefully curated mix of
    music by both emerging and established Native musicians.  

    The Alaska Federation
    of Natives (AFN) Convention is the largest representative annual gathering in
    the United States of any Native peoples. Each year, the AFN Convention draws between
    4,000–5,000 attendees. Policy guidelines and advocacy statements are set by the
    dozens of resolutions passed by voting delegates at the Convention. Since 1996,
    KNBA has produced and broadcast statewide, gavel-to-gavel coverage of this important
    three-day event. The broadcasts are aired on KNBA, streamed online, and made available
    to stations across the state. In the last decade, KNBA has added additional coverage
    from the event, including daily five-minute newscasts both in English and in Native
    languages including Iñupiaq, Athabascan, Tlingit and Yup’ik and a special hour-long
    discussion program, “Alaska’s Native Voice.” KNBA’s live, statewide broadcasts
    from the AFN Convention provide an important service to Alaskans, enabling listeners
    to stay in touch with important discussions and debates. 

    2010 Inuit Nipaat Radio
    - Koahnic Broadcast Corporation was the invited United States media provider for
    the 2010 General Assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) in Nuuk, Greenland.
    “Nipaat” is a Greenlandic and Iñupiaq word meaning “Sound,” and the broadcasts’
    title was chosen to reflect the concept that this special coverage had a distinct
    “Inuit Sound” or “Inuit Voice” to speak to Native people throughout the circumpolar
    region. Koahnic provided context, detail and analysis throughout the four-day
    proceedings with daily broadcasts. As part of the broadcasts, Koahnic produced
    five-minute recaps of each day's proceedings in English, Iñupiaq, Yup'ik and Greenlandic.
    The program was aired not only by KNBA in Anchorage, but by rural stations serving
    communities throughout Alaska including in Dillingham, Nome, Bethel, Chevak, Kotzebue,
    Barrow and Sand Point.

  history_md: |
    In 1975, four Vermonters gathered to create a public radio station for Vermont. 
    National experts tried to dissuade them, reasoning that Vermont was too rural 
    a state to support a station solely by listener support. Vermonters proved them 
    wrong on every count and now reaches listeners all over the state. Vermont 
    Public Radio was made possible by thousands of Vermonters that volunteered 
    and contributed funds to provide ongoing access to programming that informs, 
    educates and entertains and we're still going strong. For the past decade, 
    the station has consistently ranked as one of the most-listened-to public 
    radio stations in the country, based on radio listening per capita. Currently, 
    more than 26,000 people contribute to VPR.

    On October 1, 2007 Vermont Public Radio became two distinct services - VPR 
    and VPR Classical. VPR offers news and information programming along with 
    public radio entertainment favorites. And VPR Classical, our expanded network 
    of stations providing classical music 24/7.
    
    Vermont Public Radio's WVPR 89.5 FM in the Upper Valley became the first 
    radio station in Vermont to begin broadcasting in HD digital sound on July 19, 2006. 
    Fitting, given WVPR was Vermont's first public radio station.
    
    As a community licensee, Vermont Public Radio operates with a state-wide Board 
    of Directors and the majority of its funding comes from local community support.

    VPR began broadcasting as WVPR 89.5 from studios in the historic Windsor House 
    in Windsor, Vermont. In subsequent years, VPR expanded to include WVPS 107.9, 
    Burlington; WRVT 88.7 Rutland; WVPA 88.5 in St. Johnsbury and WBTN 94.3 in 
    Bennington, as well as VPR.net. In 2004, we launched WNCH 88.1 FM in Norwich, 
    our flagship station for VPR Classical, which now covers most of the state.

    As a state-wide resource, VPR is integral to the journalistic and cultural 
    life of the region. Listeners are regularly heard on VPR, via call-in 
    conversations on the daily noon newsmagazine Vermont Edition. Although it may 
    have grown in size, VPR is still driven by its original mission: to extend 
    involvement in contemporary affairs through programming that provides context 
    to the events of today and the impact they have on the lives of Vermonters.

    "VPR is a living example of what enthusiasm, vision, dedication and long-term 
    commitment can build," says Robin Turnau, VPR President and CEO. "Together 
    we've created a resource for the community that connects neighbors across 
    the state. It's a connection that will only continue to strengthen ...."

    Established in 1965 as the State-funded Hawaii Educational Television
    Network, providing educational TV for the University of Hawaii, PBS Hawaii then
    became the State’s sole member of the Public Broadcasting Service and transitioned
    to a 501c(3) nonprofit organization in 2000. PBS Hawaii complements the national
    PBS programming with a suite of local shows designed to give voice to Hawaii’s
    diverse population:  

    NĀ MELE: Traditions in Hawaiian Song is Hawaii’s only broadcast
    program that showcases the songs, artists and stories of traditional Hawaiian
    music.

    Insights on PBS Hawaii, Hawaii’s only live, primetime, weekly and interactive
    public affairs program. The entire state of Hawaii is invited to join the conversation
    with their questions and comments via phone, email or social media.

    Leahey &
    Leahey is a weekly father-son, cross-generational conversation show with local
    sportscasters Jim and Kanoa Leahey who passionately discuss “sports and other
    living things” over the Leahey family kitchen table. 

    PBS Hawaii Presents, Hawaii’s
    only weekly showcase for locally produced documentaries and performance specials
    – a venue for local storytelling at its best. 

    Long Story Short features one-on-one
    conversations with some of the most intriguing people in Hawaii. Host Leslie Wilcox
    brings out personal stories revealing experiences and values molding the people
    who shape Hawaii. 

    HIKI NŌ is a weekly half hour program of student-produced
    stories – mostly from communities rarely covered in commercial media. 
  productions_md: |
    Damien - In 1977, PBS Hawaii produced Damien, about a Roman Catholic
    priest from Belgium who spent 16 years ministering to people with Hansen’s disease
    (leprosy) on Moloka’i. He died from the disease in 1889 and was canonized in 2009.
    The program was broadcast on PBS stations across the nation and went on to win
    a Peabody award. 

    Spectrum Hawaii - Spectrum was a long-running series which
    celebrated the rich cultural and artistic life of Hawaii. In its segments are
    stories of people who may no longer be with us, and places which may no longer
    exist, making the program an archival treasure in and of itself. This is why we
    chose Spectrum for the American Archive digitization project.

    Na Mele: Na Lani
    Eha - In 2012, for the first time in almost 40 years, television cameras were
    allowed inside the nation’s only royal home, Iolani Palace, to capture musical
    performances of music written by Hawaiian royalty performed by some of Hawaii’s
    most beloved musicians. The historic, cultural, and musical significance of this
    PBS Hawaii special makes it a program that will be cherished for generations to
    come.

    HIKI NŌ - Launched in 2011, PBS Hawaii’s award-winning flagship educational
    initiative has exceeded expectations. Through HIKI NŌ, PBS Hawaii is 1) helping
    Hawaii’s students develop digital media skills, 2) creating a cadre of well-trained
    digital media teachers, 3) giving a voice to Hawaii’s youth from communities rarely
    covered by the mainstream media, and 4) uncovering a treasure trove of student
    stories that would otherwise go unheard. At a national conference of foundations
    this month, the head of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation singled out
    HIKI NŌ as one of two exciting youth journalism projects in the country.

    The Maine Public Broadcasting Network is a statewide dual licensee
    providing both television and radio service throughout the state of Maine. MPBN’s
    television service is also available in the Canadian maritime provinces and Quebec.

    Today’s
    MPBN is a result of a 1992 merger between Lewiston, Maine based WCBB and Orono,
    Maine based WMEB. 

    WCBB TV was founded by Colby College, Bates College and Bowdoin
    College and signed on as the first educational television service in Maine on
    November 13, 1961. It served the southern and western parts of the state and the
    studio was based in Lewiston.

    WMEB TV was founded by the University of Maine
    system and first went to air on October 7, 1963. Among its programs was the “Friendly
    Giant” and “History with Herb Hake”.  In 1964, transmitters are constructed in
    Presque Isle and Calais bringing educational television to northern and eastern
    Maine.  In 1974 another transmitter is built to serve southern Maine. This group
    of stations becomes known as the Maine Public Broadcasting Network in 1971. Based
    on the University of Maine campus it moves to larger facilities in Bangor in 1987.

    In
    1970, MPBN launched WMEH-FM, Maine’s first public radio service.

    WCBB and MPBN
    collaborated many times over the years but finally merged to form a single entity
    in July of 1992. After several name changes in the ensuing years, MPBN is chosen
    to represent both the television and radio services.

    Five television transmitters
    and seven radio transmitters form the statewide backbone of the transmission system.
    MPBN television provides one HD and three SD channels in its digital broadcast
    stream: regular PBS programming with occasional local productions (HD), MPBN Create
    (SD), MPBN World (SD) and a fourth channel which is used for seasonal coverage
    of the Maine Legislature (SD).

    The News Machine, and its French language counterpart La Machine
    Magique - began in 1974. This weekly half-hour was a news program aimed at grade
    school students. The French version was added to serve the French Acadian population
    of far northern Maine. Both series ran in the mid 1970s.

    La Bonne Aventure -
    a 20 episode series devoted to French heritage received national distribution
    and acclaim in 1976. In 1979 MPBN broadcast the Maine State High School Basketball
    Tournaments. This annual production continues to this day and features 44 live
    games from three locations played over the course of 2 weeks each February and
    garners some of the highest ratings of the year. 

    Maine Watch - launched in 1987.
    This weekly public affairs program ran until 2013 and included as one of its hosts
    the future Maine Governor and U.S. Senator Angus King. Maine Capitol Connection,
    daily live coverage of Maine’s legislative activities, began on February 6, 2013
    and ran for two legislative sessions.

    In 1968, the "New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority Act of 1968"
    established the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority (“NJPBA”) in response
    to the perceived lack of coverage by both commercial and public broadcasters of
    public affairs in New Jersey. NJPBA was tasked with promoting "the intellectual,
    cultural and civic development of the community by providing a broad range of
    programs for all ages." NJPBA is the FCC licensee of four television broadcast
    stations and three television translators, which are operated in concert as a
    statewide network. 

    Over 40 years of broadcasting, the NJPBA, operating under
    the name of New Jersey Public Television and then New Jersey Network, became one
    of the nation’s top public broadcasting producers of local content. The network
    developed and produced a live nightly news program, NJN News, along with several
    award-winning series and specials with a focus on public affairs, covering topics
    ranging from politics and the New Jersey Statehouse to education, health and medical
    affairs, environmental issues, youth violence, urban affairs, sports, and business
    in New Jersey.

    In July 2011, the NJPBA entered into a Programming and Services
    Agreement with Public Media, NJ (“PMNJ”), a New Jersey, not-for-profit corporation,
    to provide public television programming and services on the network under the
    name of NJTV and online at NJTVonline.org. Today, NJPBA works to ensure that PMNJ
    continues to provide high-quality, non-commercial programming that serves the
    needs and interests of the citizens of New Jersey and furthers NJPBA’s educational
    objectives.  NJPBA is also the steward of the historically and culturally valuable
    NJN program library, which contains an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 media assets
    that cover 40,000 to 50,000 hours of material. NJPBA is working toward the goal
    of cataloging, preserving, and making the 40 years’ worth of media content created
    by NJN available to the public.

    KCWC-TV/Wyoming PBS is a full-service, public television station
    licensed to Central Wyoming College, with studio and office facilities located
    in Riverton, Wyoming. The station, under call letters KCWC-TV, was built in 1982-83.
    KCWC-TV signed on the air May 10, 1983, providing approximately 16 hours of programming
    per day, with 10 full-time and 3 part-time staff. Initially the coverage area
    served was Fremont County with 33,000 people, including the Wind River Indian
    Reservation. Over the last 31 years, with the generous support of state and federal
    grants combined with private donations the station has expanded its coverage area
    to reach approximately 85% of Wyoming. To alleviate the confusion of various channel
    numbers and a multitude of call signs for each translator, KCWC-TV started using
    the title of "Wyoming Public Television," which more correctly reflected its
    statewide public television network. On January 1, 2008, after 25 years of service,
    the station adopted a new name: Wyoming PBS. The station now has 23 full-time
    staff, with approximately 5 part-time people, providing 2 channels of programming
    24 hours a day.

    KCWC-TV/Wyoming PBS was established for the purpose of providing
    a public television service and distance learning to the citizens of Wyoming.
    Recognizing that technologies have essentially eliminated time and distance, and
    created a global village, the Wyoming PBS network seeks to provide a television
    medium which recognizes the state's unique needs, and which informs, educates
    and enriches the lives of Wyoming citizens and helps them more fully understand
    and participate in local, national and global events that affect their lives.
    The station seeks to balance the differing needs of its citizens by providing
    a service that is open to public input with program offerings and services built
    around Wyoming's needs and providing communications opportunities which would
    otherwise be unavailable.

  history_md: |
    WHUT went on air on November 17, 1980 as WHMM (Howard Multimedia).
    The station came into existence through efforts that included Dr. James Cheek,
    then president of Howard University, Millard J. (Jim) Watkins, an engineer and
    now general manager, WHUR-FM, Howard University administrators, and officials
    of WETA, which had been using a trailer on the Howard University campus as one
    of its first broadcast sites.  The name was later changed from WHMM to WHUT (Howard
    University Television) when those call letters became available.  

    A great deal
    of public attention was paid locally and nationally to the station’s start as
    it was, and remains, the first and only public broadcasting (PBS) station in the
    United States licensed to and operated by a predominantly African American institution,
    or historically black college/university (HBCU).  The local community and Howard
    University supported the station and it grew under its first manager, a commercial
    broadcast veteran, Arnold Wallace.  WHMM’s first anniversary was commemorated
    with an extravagant gala hosted by comedian/actor Bill Cosby, and attended by
    notable African American personalities such as boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, and actors
    Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. 

    By its tenth year, WHUT had produced several award-winning
    programs with subject matter running the gamut from arts and healthcare to public
    affairs and athletics. Through this programming, the station developed a brand
    as a grounded, provocative, and community focused service.  The staff produced
    diverse programming delving into a multitude of topics affecting the community.
    It covered religion with Worship in Washington, entertained with Comedy Jam,
    and offered news, information, analysis and entertainment with Evening Exchange
    and @ Howard.  In 1995, it televised, live, the historic Million Man March, making
    the full event available in the over two million homes reached by WHUT’s signal.
    The station also attracted national talent and served as the production center
    for the nationally televised PBS variety show, With Ozzie and Ruby, which ran
    from 1981-82 and for The Reading Club, produced and distributed in 1999 by Bryant
    Gumbel, Renee Poussaint and Alison Davis. 

    WHUT has garnered over 14 Emmys and
    numerous other awards for its programming.  

    In 2010 the station and its staff
    of 16 completed its digital transition. WHUT is now broadcasting in high-definition
    and standard-definition.

    In January 2011 WHUT has extended its broadcast service
    to the community to a 24-hour, seven day a week presence.  

    WHUT plays an active
    role in the local community with special events and programs specifically geared
    toward literacy, STEM and early-childhood education.  WHUT has been awarded an
    American Graduate: Let’s Make It Happen community service grant from The Corporation
    for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to help Washington, DC improve youth outcomes for
    all students from preschool through college and onto careers.

    On May 1, 1988, after eight years of planning and work by an highly
    dedicated group of volunteers, WERU began broadcasting at 89.9 FM from the top
    of Blue Hill Mountain on the coast of Maine. Noel Paul Stookey (of Peter, Paul
    and Mary fame) was the station's first benefactor and from whose converted chicken
    coop, affectionately known as "The Henhouse," WERU first broadcast. 

    In 1997
    the station moved to its current location on U.S. Route 1 in East Orland, centrally
    located in the middle of the radio station’s signal area. 

    WERU is noncommercial
    and independent, and from its inception it has been a grassroots, volunteer-powered
    and listener-supported community radio service.

    WERU offers over 50 genres of
    music as well as a wide variety of national and local news, public affairs and
    short spoken-word features.  Almost all of WERU’s local content is produced by
    volunteers from the community. 

    WERU is a member of the National Federation of
    Community Broadcasters and Maine Association of Broadcasters.

  history_md: |
    On the air for 47 years, KGLT 91.9fm, alternative public radio in
    Southwest Montana, has entertained and shared diverse music played by live DJ’s
    around the clock, as well as informative programming and public service announcements,
    with its listeners.  KGLT is located on the campus of Montana State University
    (MSU), Bozeman.  With 90 live announcers playing their choice of music 22 hours
    per day, KGLT produces 1,500 to 2,000 public service announcements and offers
    three DJ apprentice classes yearly.   Approximately one third of the public service
    announcements (PSAs) relate to campus offerings such as new classes, recreational
    and volunteer opportunities, events, and informing students and employees committees
    and programs in existence to help and protect them: diversity, women's issues,
    returning vet issues, handicap rights, rape alerts, drunk driver ride home options.
    Public service issues on and off campus include Aids awareness, medical care and
    preventative options, LBGTQ support, bullying, parenting, and environmental awareness.
    The KGLT website hosts a Community Calendar that announces lectures, concerts,
    classes, nature programs, and exhibits in all areas where there are radio signals.
    Environmentally, Montana is a rare combination of being an ‘AG’ or agricultural
    state, because of all the ranching and farming, and a state also focused on maintaining
    its land untainted by industry.  Montana is dependent on the tourist trade for
    fishing, hiking, and hunting as well as summer and winter recreation.  It is one
    of the only states making a conscientious effort for a meeting of the minds of
    the ranchers and outdoors enthusiasts.  As a result, there is a lot of informative
    and educational discussion offered and shared as PSAs on the air. 

    The audiences
    reached are diverse; KGLT ranks in the top 25% of 21 stations in Gallatin County
    and collaborates with NPR stations in Montana.   KGLT is the matriarch of community
    radio in the state of Montana, offering openness, inclusiveness, and commitment
    to community.  The goal for KGLT is to reach more listeners in order to offer
    them this familial yet professional inclusivity, so that they may benefit from
    the information and education KGLT provides in music and public service.

    Apprentice
    classes give staff the opportunity to mentor students, helping them to live up
    to their potential to become informed, comfortable, well spoken, generous, and
    ethical.

    New in 2014, KGLT has worked with the Central Washington University
    radio station to help them build financial support.
  productions_md: |
    KGLT is the Emergency Alert System for Gallatin County, broadcasts
    the daily avalanche and ski reports, announces school closings, and gives a fishing
    report during the fishing season. 

    KGLT has an on air calendar called “Unzipping
    the Weekend”, sharing entertainment events and locations.  KGLT informs the public
    of City and County open forums regarding environmental and planning issues including
    water quality, building, parks, and development.  

    Listener's Personals is a
    daily report of lost animals, ride sharing, and more, with a trusted reputation
    for helping people get the help they need. 

    KGLT worked with Superintendent of
    Schools Denise Juneau, Montana Team Nutrition and first lady of Montana, Lisa
    Bullock to produce eleven announcements for use by any other station free of charge
    and posted on the Montana Food Bank Network website.  The aim of the project was
    to spread information about the importance of breakfast for students’ abilities
    to retain information and learn.  In the interest of students forging ahead to
    reach their highest potential, a KGLT student employee who is in the Music Technology
    program wrote the background music and was given credit and recognition for that.
    

    The Tellin’ Ellen program that collaboratively airs on National Public Radio
    stations in Montana, produced at KGLT, has included the subjects of Depression
    and Suicide, Mid-life job changes for women, the art of writing, an interview
    with MSU President Waded Cruzado, the first woman and Latina to hold this influential
    and important issue in Montana, a discussion about Humane Education with the Director
    of Education for the Humane Society of the United States and Giving in the workplace
    (ie.   Workplace payroll deduction options in an interview with the Executive
    Directors of United Way and Montana Shares.

    KGLT produces "Chrysti the Wordsmith",
    a two minute, 20 year old program exploring the origins and histories of words,
    phrases and idioms in the English language. The series runs on both National Public
    Radio stations in Montana: Yellowstone Public Radio in Billings and Montana Public
    Radio in Missoula.  It also is on KCPW in Salt Lake City and worldwide on Armed
    Forces Radio and Television Network. 

    "Montana Medicine Show", also produced
    at the station, consists of two minute segments of Montana history and is researched,
    written and narrated by Bozeman High School Award winning History teacher, Derek
    Strahn.  It airs six times a week on KGLT and seven times per week on three AM
    stations in Eastern Montana.  A second book of Medicine Show stories is coming
    out by summer, 2015 and the series itself will be offered to libraries across
    the state.  The first, published in 2014 is called The Montana Medicine Show's
    Genuine Montana History, by B. Derek Strahn, Montana High School History Teacher
    of the Year.

  history_md: |
    Originally known as KBDI Channel 12, Colorado Public Television (CPT12)
    is a unique civic resource and one of the country’s first alternative public television
    services. CPT12 provides important local, national and international programming
    services that are otherwise not available in Colorado.

    KBDI began operations
    in Broomfield, Colorado, with transmitting facilities on Squaw Mountain in Clear
    Creek County. At 11,500 feet, the site remains the highest of any full-power television
    station in the nation. From there, KBDI began serving first the Denver Metro area,
    and then the entire Colorado Front Range.

    Today, Colorado Public Television has
    grown to serve 85 percent of the state’s population. Ongoing improvements to its
    transmitters and wider digital carriage on cable and satellite systems are extending
    the station's reach in almost every direction across the state. Beyond Denver
    and the Front Range, CPT12 is increasingly received in various Western Slope and
    Eastern Plains communities, ever broadening its service throughout Colorado.

    Since
    2003, the station has offered digital programming on three multicast channels.
    Today, these three channels include CPT12's flagship signal (12.1), a diverse
    mix of local, national and international programming and infused with quality
    PBS shows; CPT12+ (12.2), the best of independently produced documentaries, music,
    travel, exercise, cooking, public affairs and more; and MHz Worldview (12.3),
    a lineup of programs from around the world, including world news, foreign affairs,
    international mysteries, world music, sports, and foreign films.

    Frequently stretching
    the boundaries of public television, the station has been called many things –
    progressive, provocative, experimental, controversial, outrageous, courageous
    and more as it has worked to illuminate key social issues, and provide a platform
    for the underserved.   CPT12 has always championed experimentation, creativity,
    new ideas and high broadcasting standards – all while working on a shoestring
    budget.  Today, CPT12 maintains its independent spirit, even as it explores new
    media outlets, expands its mission and deepens its community involvement.

    Described
    as “the little station that could” by the Denver Post, Colorado Public Television
    remains lean and light on its feet – a small, frugal station that continues to
    deliver programming that is relevant, informative, entertaining and thought-provoking.

    Colorado
    Public Television's tagline, “World View, Community Voice,” represents the station's
    mission, programming choices, community activities and engagement with its Colorado
    constituents. A global perspective combined with local conversations will continue
    to be CPT12's guide into the future.

    WUMB-FM is a non-commercial radio station licensed to the University
    of Massachusetts with studios at the UMass Boston Campus, as the central hub for
    a network of eight public radio stations in Boston, Worcester, Falmouth, Newburyport,
    Stow, Marshfield, Orleans and Milford, New Hampshire. 

    The Boston, Worcester
    and Falmouth stations all broadcast on 91.9FM.  The Newburyport, Stow and Marshfield
    stations can be heard on 91.7FM. The Orleans station can be heard on 1170AM, and
    Milford, New Hampshire on 88.7FM.

    All eight facilities simulcast the identical
    program schedule, which is produced from our studios located on the UMass Boston
    Campus.  The station’s 24 hour a day broadcast schedule reaches more than 80,000
    unique listeners weekly in over 275 cities and towns in eastern and central Massachusetts,
    as well as Cape Cod and parts of Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Connecticut.
    A webcast of our signal can also be heard live around the world through the
    internet, and we current reach over another 80,000 people from all 50 states and
    147 different countries through our live stream.

    The Boston station, WUMB-FM,
    was the last station in the Metro-Boston area to be granted an FM license from
    the Federal Communications Commission.  It went on the air in 1982 with an all-volunteer
    announcing staff, moving to a professional staff in 1986, when it became a public
    radio affiliate of the Corporate for Public Broadcasting.  The station was the
    aspiration of a cadre of UMass Boston students in 1968, in what became a fourteen
    year campaign to get the station on the air.  The Worcester station, WBPR-FM,
    was purchased in 1993 from Worcester county Christian Broadcasting, which owned
    a permit to construct the station, but had never actually built it.  The Falmouth
    station, WFPB-FM, was developed with the help of an expansion funding grant from
    CPB and wen on the air in 1996.  The Orleans station was a donation from GramCam
    Communications in 1998, and the Newburyport station was built with the help of
    a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2001.

    WUMB-FM is committed to
    providing unique program offerings.  It is the country’s foremost radio station
    for folk and roots music, largely airing a mix including Singer/Songwriter, Blues,
    Celtic, Americana, Bluegrass and more.  During the weekends, the station is a
    cultural center for traditional Folk, Celtic and International music, as well
    as our public affairs show, Commonwealth Journal.

    WUMB also sponsors and operates
    2 one week summer music camps for adults, as well as a weekend music getaway as
    well, geared toward furthering the participants’ musical skill.   WUMB is actively
    involved in several community engagement projects throughout the year.

  history_md: |
    The original incorporation documents of the West Central Minnesota
    Educational Television Company were filed in 1959 as part of a plan for a six-state
    educational television network to serve the Upper Midwest through a series of
    linked microwave towers. Appleton Minnesota was identified by the FCC as a logical
    location for a new link in this network because the station could bring television
    to this under served rural region and act as a relay point to carry educational
    television programming via microwave signal to other stations in the network.

    After
    several years of fundraising, the station raised enough federal, state and foundation
    support to get started.  $22,000 of this support was contributed locally by individuals,
    businesses, clubs, associations, and churches from Appleton and dozens of surrounding
    communities. Many of these gifts were $1, $2, and $5 donations from individual
    families offering what they could afford.  The Alvin Lia family donated 8 acres
    of farmland to serve as the tower site.   School District 2202 donated its old
    one-room schoolhouse to hold the television equipment and controls.  A 500-foot
    tower was erected at the transmission site and on February 7, 1966, KWCM-TV broadcast
    its first educational program. 

    Early plans called for the station to collect
    $30,000 a year in operational funds from area schools.  By 1969 however, only
    41 schools were paying membership fees.  It was clear that a more sustainable
    funding model needed to be created.  In 1975, KWCM premiered its first locally
    developed program. In 1976, PBS and CPB selected Appleton as a site for a satellite
    receiving ground terminal, giving the station access to a larger selection of
    programs.  In 1980 the board and management advanced a vision to become more responsive
    to local people through programs that featured the family farms and small towns
    of the region. In March 1980, KWCM broadcast its first membership drive.   In
    a few short years, membership and revenues doubled and soon KWCM had a new home
    in Appleton's Old City Hall, which was constructed in 1895 and is listed on the
    National Register of Historic Places.

    In 1983,  the City of Appleton received
    a grant to construct a conjoined building for additional KWCM offices and studios.
    At that time the station was re branded to be called Pioneer Public Television
    and in 1985, a new 1,200-foot tower was installed at the transmission site.  In
    October 1996, a second tower tower and transmitter building was constructed in
    Chandler, Minnesota and a new sister station, KSMN, began broadcasting. In February
    1999, another new Pioneer low power TV signal, K49FA, began broadcasting from
    Fergus Falls, completing Pioneer’s broadcast signal expansion. 

    In  1996, a  new
    local program, “Funtime Polka,” premiered. The 1990s also saw the debut of  “Prairie
    Sportsman.” In 2000, Pioneer produced “Country Spires,”  a documentary about rural
    churches in the Midwest that was broadcast on public television stations across
    the country. 

    In 2009 Pioneer began producing “Postcards,”  a weekly magazine
    program exploring the arts, history and cultural heritage of western Minnesota.
    In 2013, Pioneer’s first Upper Midwest Regional Emmy was awarded to “Caroline
    Smith: My Way Back Home”   In 2014 Pioneer was awarded an Upper Midwest Emmy for
    Haiti Love.

    As a result of the conversion to digital TV which was completed in
    2010, Pioneer now broadcasts four digital channels to a viewing area that reaches
    from Detroit Lakes, MN to Rock Rapids, IA.  Through Dish Network and DirecTV,
    Pioneer’s signal can be viewed from western Wisconsin to the Missouri River.  In
    2011, Pioneer launched its web site www.pioneer.org for online streaming of local
    programs and PBS content.

    Pioneer is currently  advancing plans to construct
    a new studio, performance space, and office space for the station. Working in
    concert with the City of Appleton, the proposal is to relocate the City’s currently
    cramped public library to Pioneer’s existing 1983 office building. In addition,
    plans call for a restoration of the historic Opera House so it can once again
    serve as an active performance venue and community hub. Finally, the proposal
    calls for the construction of a new Pioneer production and office facility (adjacent
    to the Old Opera House) that would allow the station to meet the growing need
    for meaningful content and digital communications infrastructure in the region.

    From
    the “Little Red TV Schoolhouse” to www.pioneer.org, the West Central Educational
    Television Company has continued to educate and sustain rural communities through
    communications services that reflect and uphold local values. Pioneer Public Television
    is a rare example of how democratic greater-good principles and small town cooperative
    values have been applied to the sophisticated world of broadcast communications.

  history_md: |
    In 1965, Oregon Educational Broadcasting (OEB), forerunner of Oregon
    Public Broadcasting (OPB), persuaded the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
    to reassign channel 8 from Brookings to Medford. OEB intended to make channel
    8 the third station in its television network, which at that time included flagship
    KOAC-TV in Corvallis and KOAP-TV (now KOPB-TV) in Portland. Southern Oregon was
    the only region of the state without public television. However, OEB backed out
    after a protracted battle with several commercial applicants. The license eventually
    went to Liberty Television, owners of KEZI-TV in Eugene.

    The owners of the two
    commercial stations in the area, Bill Smullin of KTVM-TV (now KOBI) and Ray Johnson
    of KMED-TV (now KTVL), helped a new nonprofit corporation, Southern Oregon Educational
    Company (SOEC), buy the channel 8 construction permit from Liberty. They also
    pledged payments of $50,000 once the station signed on. Getting the funds to sign
    on proved more difficult than expected. With the FCC permit about to run out,
    KSYS went on the air on January 17, 1977 with the strongest signal of any station
    in the region, at 191,000 watts. This was still not enough to cover Klamath Falls,
    and SOEC (later renamed Southern Oregon Public Television, Inc.) immediately applied
    for another station to cover that region. However, it took 12 more years before
    KFTS went on the air in January 1989.

    The two stations are the only public television
    stations in the state not affiliated with OPB, but occasionally air some of OPB's
    programs.

    There are also the "Presenting Station" for several national programs
    including Tommy Emmanuel and Jesse Cook pledge specials.  We also present the
    series Sierra Center Stage and Music Gone Public.

  history_md: |
    In 1966, an act of the Maryland Legislature established the Maryland
    Educational-Cultural Television Commission, the governance body of what became
    known as the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting and, later, Maryland Public
    Television. Ground was broken for a headquarters and studio facility in suburban
    Baltimore County’s community of Owings Mills on June 5, 1968, and the center went
    on the air on October 5, 1969.  The founding executive director, Dr. Frederick
    Breitenfeld, Jr., already a leading figure in public broadcasting at the time
    of his appointment, served as chief executive for 17 years.

    The center was established
    as a nonprofit, state-licensed public television network and member of the Public
    Broadcasting Service (PBS).  The state license required statewide reach, and so
    six towers across the enabled MPT to get its then-analog signal to all corners
    of Maryland and into contiguous states and the District of Columbia.  In 1976,
    the center initiated its first satellite communications project, linking two universities
    in a law school moot court competition some 22,300 miles in space.

    The 1970s
    and 1980s saw the introduction of an astounding variety of center-produced historical
    dramas, how-to programs, nature, and music offerings in addition to educational
    and cultural programming. It was during this time that several MPT series enjoyed
    their premieres and what would become decades-long popularity among viewers locally
    and nationally.  MPT was rewarded for is production prowess with dozens of Emmy®
    Awards (four of them national and the remainder regional) along with an impressive
    list of other major broadcasting honors.

    In 1984, the name Maryland Center for
    Public Broadcasting gave way to Maryland Public Television. In 2004, MPT began
    broadcasting in both analog and digital formats until digital-only transmission
    started in 2009.  In 2007, MPT introduced V-me, a 24-hour Spanish language channel,
    which joined MPT’s two other digital channels, the primary MPT-HD and secondary
    channel MPT2, in the daily programming lineup. 

    MPT has been a pioneer in the
    production, delivery and dissemination of pre-K-12 educational resources and online
    courses. The award-winning education website Thinkport.org, launched in 2003,
    offers high-quality lesson plans, digital media, learning games and resources
    for educators, schools, the child care population, and families.  

    Another MPT
    educational endeavor, started in the late 1960s, came out of the State Department
    of Education’s formation of a Division of Instructional Television.   ITV, as
    it was known, was awarded one-third of the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting’s
    available production facilities, staff, and program schedule. By 1980-81 over
    42% of Maryland teachers were using instructional television. 

    In 1970, College
    of the Air debuted, as the center became the largest U.S. producer of telecourses
    for credit. Today, via Thinkport, the platform for learning has expanded to embrace
    online and mobile technologies, but MPT remains committed to being Maryland’s
    sole statewide educator just as it was in the 1970s and ‘80s.  

    Starting in 2007,
    the Corporation for Public Broadcasting funded MPT to participate in the the American
    Archive inventory of public media content. Working on a tight deadline of five
    months beginning in late summer and finishing in December 2011, an MPT team worked
    3,500 hours and was able to inventory almost 48,000 assets.

    Today, under the
    leadership of CEO Larry D. Unger, MPT’s fifth president, some 140 staff members
    continue to produce award-winning local and national public television programs,
    to provide distinctive online content and community outreach initiatives, and
    to offer an impressive array of educational resources for children, teachers,
    families, and daycare providers across the state and nationally.

    In October 1962, the Connecticut Educational Television Corporation
    began broadcasting over station WEDH-TV (Channel 24) in black and white from the
    basement of the Trinity College Library in Hartford, Connecticut. In the beginning,
    motivated and eager individuals had a vision: to enrich people's lives through
    high-quality, non-commercial, educational programming. Institutions like Trinity
    College and the State of Connecticut supported this goal of reaching out to the
    community through public broadcasting.

    The station broadcast its first local
    children’s programming a few weeks after it went on the air, followed a month
    later by a biweekly local series highlighting the world of arts, entertainment
    and public affairs in the state. A mobile truck arrived in 1967, color in 1968,
    auctions in 1972, and pledge in 1973. By 1974, three additional stations across
    the state had joined WEDH-TV and CPTV was born. The statewide network earned its
    first Emmy Award in 1977, received its first satellite transmission in 1979, and
    taped its first national pledge special in 1985.

    The first public radio station
    in Connecticut signed on in June 1978, and soon Connecticut Public Radio (WNPR)
    joined CPTV to form what is now known as Connecticut Public Broadcasting. Initially
    airing primarily classical and radio music, WNPR now focuses on news and information.
    Together, the two community-supported, statewide public broadcasting networks
    are dedicated to serving Connecticut with a mix of educational, news, public affairs,
    children's and entertainment programming and services. 

    Today, CPTV and WNPR
    reach the entire state of Connecticut – an estimated 550,000 television viewers
    and more than 240,000 radio listeners each week. Connecticut Public Broadcasting
    is the state’s only locally owned media organization producing TV, radio, print
    and Internet content for distribution to Connecticut’s wide-ranging and diverse
    communities.

    Mundo Real (CPTV, 1976-1978) - One of the first television series
    to focus on a Puerto Rican family, Mundo Real was a Spanish-English bilingual
    educational children’s series aimed at ages 7-11. It was funded by four successive
    grants from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  A total of
    39 episodes were produced. The series was syndicated to commercial and public
    television stations throughout the country, airing on at least 60 in 1978 and
    PBS aired episodes nationally in 1981.  

    Open Air New England / The Faith Middleton
    Show (WNPR, 1981-Present) - The two-time Peabody Award-winning Faith Middleton
    Show has been widely recognized for fostering insightful, thought-provoking conversation
    for more than 30 years. Faith offers her listeners some of the world's most fascinating
    people and subjects. The show has been inducted into the Connecticut Magazine
    Hall of Fame as “Best Local Talk Show.” 

    Barney & Friends (CPTV, 1992-2005) -
    For over a decade, CPTV co-produced Barney & Friends for PBS. A CPTV executive
    thought Barney might be a good fit for television after renting a Barney video
    for his daughter. When it premiered in April 1992, the series was a huge hit,
    far more popular than anyone could have possibly imagined. 

    CPTV UConn Women's
    Basketball (CPTV, 1994-2012) - CPTV was the TV broadcast home of the phenomenally
    successful UConn Women’s Basketball team for 18 years. With some of the consistently
    highest ratings and strongest membership levels of any program on public television
    for close to two decades, UConn Women’s Basketball on CPTV is considered by many
    to be the most successful local franchise in public television history. 

    Infinity
    Hall Live (CPTV, 2011-Present) - Since 2011, CPTV has produced and distributed
    nationally to public television stations across the country this Emmy-award winning
    series that provides an all-access pass to engaging performances and backstage
    conversations with today’s most intriguing musical artists. It offers authentic
    and heartfelt performances taped at Infinity Music Hall, an acoustically perfect
    Victorian-era concert hall in Norfolk, CT. Artists featured on the series include
    The Barenaked Ladies, Joan Osborne, Fountains of Wayne, Tori Amos, and Wilson
    Phillips.

  history_md: |
    WGBH traces its roots back to 1836, when textile merchant John Lowell, Jr. (of the illustrious “Lowells of 
    Massachusetts,” one of America’s great early families) left a bequest creating “free public lectures for the benefit 
    of the citizens of Boston.” In his will, Lowell set aside $250,000 half his estate to underwrite the public lectures 
    in perpetuity.
  
    In the early 1940s the position of Trustee of the Lowell Institute passed to Ralph Lowell. Intrigued by the 
    Federal Communications Commission’s 1945 announcement that 20 of the 90 radio channels in the newly relocated 
    frequency modulation (FM) band had been reserved for noncommercial stations, Lowell considered a Lowell Institute 
    FM station as a new way to fulfill the institute’s mission. Conversations with James Bryant Conant, president of 
    Harvard University, led instead to the notion that Boston-area universities and colleges produce educational 
    programs for broadcast on commercial AM outlets.
    
    In 1946, the Lowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council (LICBC) was formed—a cooperative venture with six 
    Boston colleges, broadcasting lectures on commercial radio. 
    
    In April 1951, the WGBH Educational Foundation was formed, to launch an FM station that would carry the LICBC 
    lectures. The “GBH” stood for Great Blue Hill, the site of the station’s antenna atop a Harvard-operated weather 
    observatory. The incorporators and original board members were Ralph Lowell (as Trustee of the Lowell Institute), 
    the presidents and treasurers of Harvard and MIT, and the president of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. 
    
    Noncommercial radio station WGBH-FM made its initial broadcast on October 6, 1951: the first Saturday-evening 
    performance of the BSO’s 71st season, live from Boston’s famed Symphony Hall. The broadcast opened with words of 
    welcome from Ralph Lowell and BSO President Henry Cabot. It was the first full-length broadcast of a symphony concert 
    in Boston in 25 years. Only 15 percent of the households in Greater Boston had FM receivers, but WGBH’s premiere foray 
    was considered a rousing success. During its first year, WGBH-FM broadcast 2,600 hours of programming—10 times the 
    amount the LICBC had been allotted on commercial radio.
    
    On May 2, 1955, WGBH-TV signed on for the first time. Its first broadcast was Come and See, a program for young 
    children with folk singer Tony Saletan and Mary Lou Adams from Tufts University Nursery Training School. That was 
    followed by Louis Lyons (a WGBH-FM fixture) reading the news before a camera. 
    
    Most early “Channel 2” programs were course lectures: French Through Television, Your Income Taxes, From Criminal 
    to Citizen. Over time, WGBH made its mark by creating programs locally that were shared with other stations—this prior 
    to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service. Notable among them was Prospects of Mankind, a monthly series in 
    which former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt interviewed statesmen from all over the world.
    
    In 1962, WGBH produced three programs on French cooking, after a Cambridge cookbook author appeared on a WGBH 
    book-review program and whipped up not only egg whites but an interest in how-to television. Within a year The French 
    Chef with Julia Child was teaching audiences in several major cities to cook with courage. “Educational TV” had its 
    first national star—and WGBH had the first in a long line of productions that would transform American broadcasting 
    and put the Boston station on the map.
    
    Today, WGBH is public broadcasting for New England, the number one producer of PBS programming (on TV, the Web, 
    online, and mobile), a major source of public radio content, and a pioneer in both educational multimedia and media 
    access solutions serving millions of people with disabilities.

   WGBH’s best-known television series include Frontline, NOVA, American Experience, Masterpiece, and PBS’ #1 rated 
   Antiques Roadshow. A record in award-winning programs for children began in 1972 with Zoom and includes past shows 
   such as Degrassi Junior High, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, Between the Lions, and FETCH! with Ruff 
   Ruffman. Current children’s programs include the #1 PBS show for preschoolers (Curious George), the top two ranked 
   PBS programs for kids 6-11 (Curious George and Arthur, respectively), and the popular series Peep and the Big Wide 
   World, Martha Speaks, and Design Squad Nation. 
   
   WGBH Radio distributes national productions such as The World (co-produced by WGBH, PRI, and the BBC), which 
   reaches 2.5 million listeners. WGBH Radio also serves our local community through analog and digital high-definition 
   radio stations, including 89.7 FM and 99.5 FM All Classical. Our radio broadcasts reach over 335,000 listeners weekly, 
   and over a hundred thousand more log on to wgbh.org’s live audio streaming each month. In 2012, WGBH acquired 
   Public Radio International, whose programs can be heard on over 800 public radio stations.
   
   WGBH’s local television productions address the needs and interests of the region through programs like Greater 
   Boston (a daily news and public affairs show) and Basic Black (a weekly series focusing on the African-American 
   experience in Boston and beyond). La Plaza, a weekly local program on the culture and concerns of Latino 
   communities, aired for over 30 years on WGBH. A recent addition to WGBH’s local line-up is High School Quiz Show, 
   a televised match-up of competing quiz bowl teams from high schools across the state that is now in its fourth 
   season. In 2012, WGBH pioneered a new partnership with New Hampshire Public Television (NHPTV), which will 
   streamline operations and encourage the continued production of thoughtful, community-driven public media.
